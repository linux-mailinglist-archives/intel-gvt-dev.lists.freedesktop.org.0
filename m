yes, it's just an example. It's exported to be used by userspace perf &
trace_cmd.

if this is easy for openstack, maybe we can organize the data like below way?
 
 |- [device]
    |- migration
        |-self
	|-compatible1
	|-compatible2

e.g. 
#cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/UUID1/migration/self
 	filed1=xxx
 	filed2=xxx
 	filed3=xxx
 	filed3=xxx
#cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/UUID1/migration/compatible
 	filed1=xxx
 	filed2=xxx
 	filed3=xxx
 	filed3=xxx

or in a flat layer
 |- [device]
    |- migration-self-traits
    |- migration-compatible-traits

I'm not sure whether json format in a single file is better, as I didn't
find any precedent.

I heard that cyborg can parse the kernel interface and generate several
traits without understanding the meaning of each trait. Then it reports
those traits to placement for scheduling.

but I agree if mdev creation is involved, those traits need to match
to mdev attributes and mdev_type.

could you explain a little how you plan to create a target mdev device?
is it dynamically created during searching of compatible mdevs or just statically
created before migration?

I think below is already in a way of listing feature supported.
The reason I also want to declare compatible lists of features is that
sometimes it's not a simple 1:1 matching of source list and target list.
as I demonstrated below,
source mdev of (mdev_type i915-GVTg_V5_2 + aggregator 1) is compatible to
target mdev of (mdev_type i915-GVTg_V5_4 + aggregator 2),
               (mdev_type i915-GVTg_V5_8 + aggregator 4)

and aggragator may be just one of such examples that 1:1 matching is not
fit.
so I guess it's best not to leave the hard decision to openstack.

Thanks
