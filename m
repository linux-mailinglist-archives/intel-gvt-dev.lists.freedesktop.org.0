Dear Sir/Madam
 =

I work as an agent to some Investors. Do you need a business loan or
funds for a business idea or want to expand but need huge funding? We
are expanding our investment presence by granting debt loan to fund
viable and lucrative projects.
 =

If you have any project that needs funding, kindly revert to me with your b=
usiness plan and if we find your business to be worthy of investment, you w=
ill be promptly contacted and both parties will meet face to face and have =
a round-table meeting together.
 =

Good documentation will be carried out between you and the Investor
before putting down his funds.

Regards
