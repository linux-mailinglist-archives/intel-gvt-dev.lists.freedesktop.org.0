Hello,

I wish to introduce you to a very lucrative business. I worked as a product sourcing manager with an import and export company here in Cote d'Ivoire.In a business seminar I attended sometimes in 2019, I met one Alhaji, who is the president & CEO of a big cattle and dairy farm here in my country. Alhaji informed me that he needed a particular vaccine which he usually buys at USD2,000 per carton and he buys up wards of 3000 cartons every three months. Back in my office, I carried out a market research and discovered that we could purchase this medicine cheaper somewhere in Europe for US$575.00 per carton.

I discussed this proposal with my boss and he decided to handle the supply by himself.We moved a proposal to Alhaji to supply him with this vaccine at US$1,500.00 per carton which he accepted.My boss has supplied this vaccine to Alhaji for more than four times now, making a very huge profit.My problem now is that my boss has vehemently refused to pay me my share of the profit as we agreed.As a result of this, I decided to arrange with Alhaji to link him to the real producers of the vaccine who will give him the vaccine at a cheaper rate. After my discussion with Alhaji, I offered to supply him the vaccine at a cheaper rate of USD1,250 per carton of 12 bottles. Alhaji accepted my offer and now wants to place order for more than 3650 cartons of the vaccine. Right now, Alhaji has stopped all communications with my boss.

I therefore wish to present you as my foreign contact so that you can handle the supplies to Alhaji. If you can handle the contract, kindly contact me immediately for details and negotiations on what is going to be my commission.We will get the medicine from the producers at US$575 and supply to Alhaji at US$1250 per carton of 12 bottles(500ml).Alhaji also agreed to make a down payment of 70% of his total order to your company for the procurement of the vaccine.

Thanks and God bless you.

David Pascal
