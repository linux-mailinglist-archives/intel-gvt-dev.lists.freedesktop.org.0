<p>Office Of The Director,<br />

NW, Washington, D.C. 20535-0001, USA.<br />
<br />
Dear Sir/Madam&nbsp; , intel-gvt-dev,<br />
<br />
The attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been directed by o=
ur=20
International Operations Division on your transaction with the National Ban=
k of=20
Belgium (NBB) concerning your over-due inheritance/contract payment. It mig=
ht=20
interest you to learn that we have fully analyzed the transaction as stipul=
ated=20
by our Investigative Operational Guidelines and have confirmed that it is 1=
00%=20
genuine and hitch-free, and of which you have the legitimate right to claim=
.<br />
<br />
We recently had our spring meetings with the Governor of the National Bank =
of=20
Belgium, Mr. Ronald J. Gidwitz, and some top officials of the ministry in r=
egard=20
to the subject matter, and we were led to understand that your payment file=
 was=20
held in abeyance pending when you personally apply for its claim. But the m=
ajor=20
challenges facing the Bank are (i). Some unscrupulous elements are using th=
is=20
project as an avenue to scam innocent people off their hard-earned money by=
=20
impersonating the Governor or an official of the National Bank of Belgium. =
(ii).=20
A woman named Mrs. Linda Box, from New York submitted an application to NBB=
 with=20
a power of attorney and some official documents (allegedly signed by you) p=
rior=20
to the release of your Funds (US$8,000,000.00) to her due to your ill healt=
h.<br />
<br />
<br />
In view of all these, we have been urged to warn beneficiaries who have rec=
eived=20
information pertaining to their outstanding inheritance/contract payment to=
 be=20
very careful, in order not to be a victim of circumstance. In case you are=20
already dealing with someone from the National Bank of Belgium/Any Bank or=20
whichever office, you are strictly advised to DESIST from further communica=
tion=20
with that individual in your best interest, and thereby contact the real of=
fice=20
of the National Bank of Belgium via the below information:<br />
<br />
Name: Mr. Pierre Wunsch<br />
Office Address: Boulevard De Berlaimont 14<br />
1000 Brussels, Belgium<br />
Email:pierrewunsch29554@gmail.com<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: You should ignore any message that does not come from the above email=
=20
address for security reasons. And to enable the National Bank of Belgium to=
=20
process and release the fund to you, you are required to re-confirm your fu=
ll=20
details such as:<br />
<br />
<br />
Your full name:<br />
Contact Home Address:<br />
Your Cell Phone Number:<br />
Your Date of Birth:<br />
Sex:<br />
Country:<br />
<br />
Ensure that you abide by the National Bank of Belgium due process in line w=
ith=20
the International Banking Secrecy Act, to avoid any form of a discrepancy, =
which=20
may hinder your fund's transfer.<br />
Thanks for your understanding and cooperation as we earnestly await your ur=
gent=20
reply.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
