Urgent Business Proposal.

Dear ​

Please let this email don't be a surprise to you. I got your name and email address from the Japanese chamber of commerce business directory, and I decided to email you for a business proposal. My name is Mr. Desmond Campbell, I work with the investor's center of the London stock exchange group Plc. We have for some years now, been dealing with some unclaimed shares running to the tune of 8.4 Million Thousand Pounds and recently my boss secretly decided to sell it off with the intention that the two of us will make use of the fund for investment outside the stock house.

An American investor has paid for the unclaimed shares in Dollars and the cash has been received and saved in China Citic Bank (CCB) for onward movement outside the Country. But unfortunately, my boss passed away two months ago, and the family has read his last testament (WILL) without mentioning anything about this cash deposited in China Citic Bank (CCB).

So at this point, I was the only person that knows this deal and where this money is. But,  since I cannot do it alone, I contacted my boss wife and told her all that transpired while her husband was alive and I am the only trusted partner who knows about this money because of this, she has given me the go ahead order to make sure I get a trusted person  overseas who will receive this fund and share it, so that her family will make use of their own share of the money to complete her husband’s intention and his soul will rest in peace.

The total amount in Dollars is US$10,636,352.96 and this amount is still available in China Citic Bank (CCB). Reply via my private email: ( mrdesmondcampbell001@englandmail.com ), while a legal practitioner will use this details to get a legal permit for you to receive this cash outside this Country for our sharing. You will be given 30% out of the total sum, according to the agreement between me and my boss' wife.

Your cooperation is highly expected to help this widow and her children.

Yours truly,
Mr. Desmond Campbell
