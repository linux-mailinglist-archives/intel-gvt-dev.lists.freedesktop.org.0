 most significant developments in the modern-day bolt and screw processes w=
ere made during the last 150 years. Experts differ as to the origins of the=
 humble nut and bolt. In his article ?Nuts and Bolts?, Frederick E. Graves =
argues that a threaded bolt and a matching nut serving as a fastener only d=
ates back to the 15th century. He bases this conclusion on the first printe=
d record of screws appearing in a book in the early 15th century. However, =
Graves also acknowledges that even though the threaded bolt dates back to t=
he 15th century, the unthreaded bolt goes back to Roman times when it was u=
sed for ?barring doors, as pivots for opening and closing doors and as wedg=
e bolts: a bar or a rod with a slot in which a wedge was inserted so that t=
he bolt could not be moved.? He also implies that the Romans developed the =
first screw, which was made out of bronze, or even silver. The threads were=
 filed by hand or consisted of a wire wound around a rod and soldered on. A=
ccording to bolt expert Bill Eccles? research, the history of the screw thr=
ead goes back much further. Archimedes (287 BC?212 BC) developed the screw =
principle and used it to construct devices to raise water. However, there a=
re signs that the water screw may have originated in Egypt before the time =
of Archimedes. It was constructed from wood and was used to irrigate land a=
nd remove bilge water from ships. ?But many consider that the screw thread =
was invented around 400 BC by [Greek philosopher] Archytas of Tarentum, wh=
