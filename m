Hello Dear,

I hope this message finds you well. Upon reviewing your profile, I was insp=
ired by your character and felt compelled to reach out regarding a business=
 opportunity that could be mutually beneficial. Specifically, I am seeking =
a trustworthy individual for a transaction involving an inheritance claim l=
eft behind by the late Mr. Burhan, tragically passed away from COVID-19 on =
March 2, 2020, at the age of 71. He left behind a substantial deposit of $7=
,500,000 (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in his=
 account with our Bank. Despite his passing, no one has come forward to cla=
im these funds. The bank's board of directors has instructed me as his Acco=
unt Officer before his sudden death to locate his next of kin in order to r=
elease the deposit. However, as Mr. Burhan did not specify a next of kin in=
 his security file with the bank, I am reaching out to you for a sincere co=
llaboration in partnership to actualize this potential.

I propose to share the proceeds from this transaction based on a percentage=
 ratio that I believe will be agreeable to you. Upon successful completion =
of the transaction, you will receive 40%, while I will take 50%, and 10% wi=
ll be allocated for any incurred expenses. I will provide you with further =
details upon receiving your satisfactory reply via my personal email:(DonLu=
isMunozParrondo@mail.com)

Best regards,
Don, luis Munoz Parrondo@mail.com
(DonLuisMunozParrondo@mail.com)
