<DIV>
<B>Dear Sir/Madam,</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics but embarrasing.I wish</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>introduce myself as James W. Leeds, Station Manager at the Accounts Management Section(AMS) of the</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>above bank here in London Uk.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>In the course of our routine internal audit a discovery was made on One of our accounts with holding</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>a closing balance of £36,100,000.00 GBP (Thirty Six Million and One Hundred Thousand British pounds)</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>and has been dormant and has not been operated for the past two (2) years. Then I took up an interest</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>and from my investigations and findings, the owner of the account, a Russian (foreigner) by name</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Natalia Fileva who died in a ghastly plane crash near Frankfort in Germany, see this link;</B></DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
<B>The 55-year-old was listed in 2018 by Forbes magazine as the fourth richest women in Russia with an</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>estimated fortune of $660 million (£534 million) and since this tragic incident nobody has done</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>anything as regards the claiming of this money because she has no family members who are aware of the</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>existence of neither the account nor the funds.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>I have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official of this bank and we have agreed to find a</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>This transaction is totally free of risk and as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug,</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act. On receipt of your response I will furnish you with</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>detailed clarification as it relates to this mutual benefit transaction.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Please upon receipt of this mail let me have your quick and cordial response hence your willingness to</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>cooperate ith us to make this venture a reality via my private email: </B><A href="amg3333txx101@yandex.com"><FONT color=#0000FF><B><U>amg3333txx101@yandex.com</B></U></FONT></A><B> and let</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>me have your direct telephone numbers for the effective communication required in this operation and you</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>should fee free to ask any question you may have.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B> </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible with your readiness, willingness and ability (RWA)</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>to collaborate with us in this juicy operation.</B></DIV>
