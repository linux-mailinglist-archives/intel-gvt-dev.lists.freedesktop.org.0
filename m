Dear Friend,
I Am Mr.Udoo K.Banney K.Banney  the director in Charge Of Auditing and 
Accounting Section of (UBA Bank Benin Republic) with due respect and 
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that 
will benefit the both of us at the end of the transaction. In order to 
transfer out the sum of (US$10 Million) Ten Million United State 
Dollars) from one of the leading banks in Benine City Bank Benin 
Republic into a foreign account provided, I need a foreigner who is 
reliable and honest person who is capable and fit to receive this money 
through a bank to bank wire transfer

During the course of our auditing last month, I discovered a floating 
fund in an account opened in the bank in 2014 and since 2021 nobody has 
operated on this accountagain,after
going through some old files, I discovered that the owner of the account 
did not states any Next Of Kin, hence the money is floating and if I do 
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing by 
our management.

The owner of this Account is Engineer {Fredrick} a foreigner,and an 
industrialist,and no other person knows about this account or any thing 
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation 
prove to me to be perfect and risk free. However, I am revealing this to 
you believing in God that you will never let me down when the money is 
transferred into your foreign nominated bank account. at the conclusion 
of this business, I will give to you 40% of the total amount, while 60% 
will be for me

Am looking forward to hearing from you. Reply me back at this 
alternative E-mail address: (ozudo00@gmail.com) you can include your 
telephone or mobile number for easy Communication.
Best Regards
Mr.Udoo K.Banney
Urgent response needed.
