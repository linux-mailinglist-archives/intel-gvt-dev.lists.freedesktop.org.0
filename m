what about leveraging the flags in vfio device info ?

#define VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_RESET (1 << 0)        /* Device supports reset */
#define VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_PCI   (1 << 1)        /* vfio-pci device */
#define VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_PLATFORM (1 << 2)     /* vfio-platform device */
#define VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_AMBA  (1 << 3)        /* vfio-amba device */
#define VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_CCW   (1 << 4)        /* vfio-ccw device */
#define VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_AP    (1 << 5)        /* vfio-ap device */

Then for migration_version string,
The first 64 bits are for device type, the second 64 bits are for device id.
e.g.
for PCI devices, it could be
VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_PCI + PCI ID.

Currently in the doc, we only define PCI devices to use PCI ID as the second
64 bits. In future, if other types of devices want to support migration,
they can define their own parts of device id. e.g. use ACPI ID as the
second 64-bit...

sounds good?
