My Name is Miss Jennifer Brown. I would like to inquire about your
services to be my foreign partner/investor and help me transfer and
manage my funds by investing in profitable ventures such as buying
company shares or Properties in your country. I have a reasonable
amount that I inherited from my late father, as I would like you to
help me invest in your country.
I am attaching my personal photos, proof of payment of the fund, my
international passport, my late father's death certificate and a four
page will from my then dad. I send you all this so that you can trust
that you are dealing with a real personNote: Below are the main reasons
I am contacting you.(1) To provide a new empty bank account in which
these funds would reside. if you do not want us to use your personal
account.(2) Acting as custodian of this fund because the bank insisted
that their agreement with my father was that I get a foreign partner
first to release the fund.(3) To make arrangements for me to come over
to your country to promote my education and to obtain a residence
permit in your country.Please reply as soon as you have read this
message for more information and evidence.Sincerely,Miss Jennifer
Brown.
