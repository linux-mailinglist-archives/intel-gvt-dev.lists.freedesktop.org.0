We tried DRM UI with page flip events, the performance is great, even in th=
e case of front buffer rendering. For the UI like GTK, vblank event is bett=
er.=20

The idea is to deliver an event to tell userspace that "guest has
display update, you need to refresh your UI". How driver
implementation uses either vblank or page flip to determine that is
driver specific, as same routine of vfio gfx interface will be used to
refresh on guest display.

If userspace doesn't set irq for vfio gfx display, it would just use
own timer.
