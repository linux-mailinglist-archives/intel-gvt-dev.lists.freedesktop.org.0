Hello Dear,

I know this email will be a thing of surprise to you , especially you
not knowing me surprising you with such a business deal which is
highly strict and confidential.

On this day I ask You to grant this request? may I know who I am and
what I am,every moment of every day.may I be a catalyst for light and
love,and bring inspiration to those whose eyes I meet.may I have the
strength to stand tall in the face of conflict,and the courage to
speak my voice, even when I'm scared.may I have the humility to follow
my heart,and the passion to live my soul's desires.May I seek to know
the highest truth and dismiss the gravitational pull of my lower self.

My Name is Mr Mohammad Charits national of Indonesia , i worked with Bank
SBI as an General accountant , before my retirement i have a customer
who i supervised as his account officer with Bank SBI Indonesia
unfortunately his among in last plane crash took place at Sriwijaya
Air Boeing 737 left Jakarta with 62 people on board, but vanished from
the radar on its way to Borneo island on Saturday 11 Jan 2021.

Please click below to read and understand.

( https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55614074 )

He left his $45.8 Million United State Dollars with Bank SBI Jakarta
Indonesia , my aim of contacting you is i found out you have a similar
name with him which i can use you as his sibling to claim the funds
easily.

I assure you if you follow my directives we will achieve our aim.

I will be waiting your respectable response.

Regards,
Mohmmad Charits.
