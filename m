The solution I envision thus far does two things:

 - Move the struct mdev_parent and its friends out of struct
subchannel, and into struct vfio_ccw_private. This struct is allocated
just prior to the call to mdev_register_device/_parent, and released
with the mdev_unregister. It's also a device-specific struct linked
from the device-agnostic subchannel.
 - Add a kref to struct vfio_ccw_private. The mdev_parent currently has
one, which is now unnecessary since it's embedded in another struct,
but it leaves vfio_ccw_private rather racy.

I suspect the second item (or something similar) is needed anyway,
because Alex' tree + this series crashes frequently in (usually)
mdev_remove. I haven't found an explanation for how we get in this
state, but admittedly didn't spent a lot of time on them since the
proposed changes to struct subchannel are a non-starter. The other
crashes were always in something that's almost certainly a victim of
something else, like kmalloc-related stuff in net/skbuff.

With the above, the crashes out of the vfio-ccw stack disappear, and
things work a bit better. But those random kmalloc-related crashes
persist. I guess I'll pick those up tomorrow.

Eric
