Hello,

I hope that this correspondence is received with the
urgency and expediency required.

It has come to the notice of the Board of Trustees of
the Federal Clearing House here in Washington, D.C. that
your outstanding funds application being handled by the
Remitting Offices in Africa is experiencing some man made
irregularities. To this effect, it has become necessary
for the Board of Trustees to assign trained Fund Transfer
Specialists from the United States to resolve and regularize
your fund release with immediate effect.

We at John Knowles & Consults have been duly consulted
by the Federal Reserve Board of Trustees in Washington.
We have been fully informed about how the staff of the
remitting offices have been taking advantage of you by
telling you to pay unnecessarily exorbitant charges which
will only make your fund payment a long drawn out process.

Due to this development, we have been assigned to step
into the immediate processing of your claims application
to enable your funds to be transferred to you within the
shortest possible time. To implement this, you are to
get back to us immediately without needing to pay all
the huge sums of monies that are being demanded from
you by the previous handlers at the remitting bank.

All processes to have your funds paid to you immediately
through the Liaison Remittance Office in New York
have been initiated to cut out unnecessary costs.

You are advised to treat this communication with the urgency
and seriousness required as the Board of Trustees of the Federal
Reserve has mandated us to resolve this fund payment within
the next three working days independent of the Remitting
Offices in Africa.

Furthermore,you are hereby advised to pay no further fees or
charges to these offices as they shall no longer be handling your
payment process.

We shall await your immediate correspondence with your direct
telephone numbers to my private email address at ( john.knowles1960@gmail.com )
for re-confirmation so that we mayconclude your payment immediately.

Yours Sincerely,
John Knowles.
John Knowles & Consults.
