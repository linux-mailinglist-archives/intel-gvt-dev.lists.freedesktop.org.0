Hi,
I want to share a message that has been spreading all over the
inte=
rnet that concerns the times we are living in. Whether you believe
in God=
 or not, this is a must read message!
We can see throughout time how we h=
ave been slowly conditioned to
come to this point where we are on the ver=
ge of a cashless society.
Would it surprise you to know that the Bible fo=
retold of this event?
Don't believe me? This may be the most imporant mes=
sage you will read
in these times...please do not ignore this!
This mes=
ssage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and the meaning
behind count=
ing a number people have been pondering for centuries,
666. This message =
also shares why Barack Obama will be the Antichrist
as well as the gospel=
 message. This is truly a message from God!
In the Revelation of Jesus Ch=
rist given to the apostle John, we read:
...."Also he (the false prophet =
who deceives many by his miracles)
compels all, the small and the great, =
and the rich and the poor, and
the free men and the slaves, to be given a=
 mark on their right hand or
on their forehead signifying allegiance to t=
he beast, and that no one
will be able to buy or sell, except the one who=
 has the mark, either
the name of the beast or the number of his name. He=
re is wisdom. Let
the person who has enough insight calculate the number =
of the beast,
for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundre=
d and
sixty-six" (Revelation 13:16-18 AMP).....
Referring to the last g=
eneration, this could only be speaking of a
cashless money society, which=
 we have yet to see, but are heading
towards. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells=
 us that we cannot buy or sell
unless we receive the mark of the beast in=
 our right-hand or forehead.
We could still buy or sell among one another=
 without receiving the
mark if physical money was still currency. It logi=
cally deduces itself
to this reason.
These verses could not be referrin=
g to something spiritual because
the word references two different physic=
al locations (our right-hand
or forehead) stating the mark will be on one=
 "OR" the other. It once
again logically deduces itself to this reason.=

Here is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how
ac=
curate the Bible is concerning the RFID microchip. These are notes
from a=
 man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to
help devel=
op this microchip in the late 1960's.
Mr. Carl Sanders attended 17 New Wo=
rld Order meetings with
heads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger =
and Bob Gates of the
CIA to talk about their agenda on how to bring forth=
 this one-world
system. The US government commissioned Carl Sanders to in=
vent a
microchip for identifying and controlling the peoples of the world=
-a
microchip that might be placed underneath the skin with a hypodermic=

needle (a fast, convenient system that would be gradually accepted by
=
the world).
Carl Sanders, with a crew of engineers with him, with U.S. gr=
ant
monies provided by US tax dollars, took on this project and produced =
a
RFID chip which is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable by way
=
of the temperature changes in our skin. With out the knowledge of the
hol=
y Bible (Carl Sanders was not a believer at the time), these men
spent on=
e-and-a-half-million dollars gathering data on the best and
most convenie=
nt spot to have the RFID chip inserted.
Guess what? These researchers dis=
covered that the forehead and the
back of the hand (the two locations Rev=
elation says the mark will go)
aren't just the most convenient locations,=
 but are also the only
viable locations for constant, consistent temperat=
ure changes in the
skin to recharge the lithium battery. The RFID chip is=
 approximately 7
millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in diameter, abou=
t the
dimensions of a grain of rice. It's capable of storing pages of
i=
nformation about you. All your standard records, work data, crime
history=
, health history, and financial information will be saved on
this chip.=

Carl Sanders believes that this RFID chip, which he remorsefully
helpe=
d invent, is the "mark of the beast" spoken about in Revelation
13:16-18.=
 The Greek word for "mark" is "charagma," which means a
"scratch or etchi=
ng." Additionally it is fascinating to be aware that
the number 666 is a =
word in the original Greek. This word being "chi
xi stigma," with the las=
t part, "stigma," also meaning "to stick or
prick. Carl believes this is =
referencing to the usage of a hypodermic
needle being poked into a person=
 to insert the RFID chip."
Carl Sanders asked a Boston Medical Center doc=
tor what would happen
if the lithium contained within the RFID microchip =
leaked into the
body. The doctor responded that if the microchip broke in=
side a human
body, the lithium would cause a severe and painful wound fil=
led with
pus. This is what the scriptures of Revelation 16:2 has to say:=

"So the first angel poured his bowl on the earth, and a nasty and
terr=
ible sore appeared on the people who had the beast=E2=80=99s mark and
wor=
shipped its image" (Revelation 16:2 CEB).
THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE N=
UMBER 666 REVEALED!
What I first want to mention, before I share what the=
 Holy Spirit has
revealed to me concerning the number of the beast, is th=
at God
confirms in threes. We can see this throughout scripture:
"For t=
here are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the
Word, and the=
 Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV).
"and that He wa=
s buried, and that He rose again the third day
according to the Scripture=
s" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).
"...Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Wh=
o was and is and is to
come!" (Revelation 4:8 NKJV).
There are many mor=
e examples, but I thought I would just share three
of them to make the po=
int.
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first group of three I would=

like to point out is that the mark of the beast is described in three
=
separate verses, 16, 17 and 18.
The next three I see is in verse 16, "He =
causes all..." is followed
by three contrasting categories of people,
1=
 - "both small and great,
2 - rich and poor,
3 - free and slave...".
=
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may buy or sell
excep=
t one who has...", followed by three explanations of what one
must have t=
o buy or sell,
1 - "...the mark
2 - or the name of the beast,
3 - or =
the number of his name".
Now unto verse 18, we read "Let him who has unde=
rstanding
calculate...", which is followed by,=C2=A0
1 - "the number of=
 the beast,
2 - for it is the number of a man:
3 - His number is 666".=

The last three I see is the number "6" being used three times in a
row=
. The reason I'm making this point about God confirming in three is
becau=
se it is the key to unlocking how to calculate the number 666.
Throughout=
 the centuries there have been people trying to calculate
numbers based o=
n titles and names that come up to the number 666 to
identify one person,=
 the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do
not see where God is tel=
ling us to count up to 666, but rather to
count the number of the beast. =
This number is identified as 666. So
the verse is telling us to count the=
 number 666.
What does it mean to count? It means to add up. So how could=
 we add
up 666? Remember my previous point about God confirming in threes=
 is
key to unlocking the number 666. So logically, what would be the best=

way to count the number 666? To count it equally by using the rule of
=
three based off the number.
We cannot count it equally as 600+60+6, this =
would also bring us back
to the start.
We cannot count it as 600+600+60=
0, or 60+60+60 because there are no
zeroes in between or at the end of 66=
6.
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.
What is interesting is that t=
he verse that reveals for us to count
the number itself is verse 18 (ther=
e a total of 18 verses in
Revelation Chapter 13), being the third verse o=
ut of the three verses
that describe the mark of the beast in Revelation =
13:16,17,18. What is
18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D18, or 6+6+6=3D18.
An=
other interesting point is the only two other combinations (making
a tota=
l of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" symbol in
between 666=
 are:
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's togeth=
er and you get 144.
Why the number 144 is worth our attention is because =
the verse
following Revelation 13:18 is the first time in the Bible where=
 the
144,000 are being described in detail:
"Then I looked, and behold,=
 a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with
Him one hundred and forty-four t=
housand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name
written on their foreheads..." =
(Revelation 14:1).
Now if you add up all three numbers from counting 666 =
by moving the
"+" symbol around, it would be 72+72+18=3D162. What is comp=
elling about
the number 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 88=
8. The
name of Jesus in Greek gematria adds up to 888. The New Testament =
was
originally written in the Greek language. Revelation 14:1 not only
=
mentions the 144,000, but also the Lamb who is Jesus.
Now what is interes=
ting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that if
you apply the same formu=
la that was used to count 666, you get
8+8+8=3D24. Why the number 24? Rev=
elation chapter 4 tells us there are
24 elders seated around the throne o=
f God. This is the same throne
where Jesus sits.
Now if you take:
=
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96
you get =
24+96+96=3D216.
Take 144,000 divided by 216 and you get 666.
Remember t=
hat this was the same exact formula we used to count the
number 666 that =
ultimately brought forth the number 888.
Here is a quick recap to demonst=
rate how this formula confirms itself
as being the true way to count 666:=

1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162
=
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888
3: 8+8+8=3D24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+8=
8=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216
4: 144,000 divided by 216=3D666
1: 6+6+6=
=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...
As you can see, it is perpetual. And remember t=
hat we consistently
used a formula that worked in threes being the number=
 that God uses
for confirmation.
With making use of the identical metho=
d of counting by including the
plus symbol in between the numbers, why do=
 all these numbers relate in
such a way?
The book of Revelation contain=
s the use of the number 7 in various
forms. For instance 7 seals, 7 trump=
ets, and 7 bowls. What is
interesting about the number 37 (three sevens) =
is if if you divide any
number that contains the same single digit three =
times in a row, such
as 111 to 999, it comes out to the value of if you w=
ere to add all
three numbers up. For example 888 divided by 37 equals 24.=
 So
8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+6=3D18. Could this=
 be
another way of God's word confirming itself that the mystery behind=

calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?
Another fascinating factor to=
 be aware is that if you add up all the
numbers from 1 to 36 (1+2+3...+36=
), it totals 666. The number 36, as
in three sixes? May this be a hint th=
at we should add up three sixes
instead of perceiving the number as six-h=
undred sixty six?
So what may this mean? Well we know in this world we ar=
e recognized
by numbers in various forms. From our birth certificates to =
our social
security card, also with our drivers license, being recognized=
 founded
on a system of ruler ship. So it's conceivable that this RFID ch=
ip
will incorporate a brand new identification that has a complete total=

of 18 characters.
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let him=
 calculate the
number of the wild beast, number for "of human" it is, and=
 the number
of it 666" (Revelation 13:1, Greek Translation).
The Greek =
word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of
human" is =
the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two
definitions of the word=
 are "a human being, whether male or female",
and, "generically, to inclu=
de all human individuals". Could the number
of the beast apply to all man=
kind?
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the Greek=

language), and other translations, you will notice the beast is
descri=
bed as an "it", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this
point is bec=
ause when a translation says "His number is 666", this
would imply a sing=
ular person, the Antichrist. But by saying "the
number of it 666", implie=
s that it is of the beast system as a whole.
We can know the number of th=
e beast cannot be to identify products
(like a new barcode) to buy or sel=
l because scripture says we cannot
buy or sell without the number of the =
beast. What am I getting at?
There will be instances where you could buy =
something someone made
themselves and it wouldn't have a store branded id=
entification on it.
But for this number to be in our chips, that is where=
 it must be to
conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or sell without hav=
ing the
number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Revelation 13:18,=
 the
number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", definition
"=
generically, to include all human individuals".
May this be the title of =
the beast, the number of its name? The
one-world beast system that is rec=
ognized by 18 characters? This might
fit the scriptures that speaks of a =
mark that we must have to buy or
sell in our right hand or forehead, and =
that it additionally includes
the number of the beast, throughout a futur=
e cashless money society.

to see all the proof!
"Why did=
 the Biden campaign choose 30330? 2020 divided by 666 =3D
3.0330 Who beli=
eves this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:6
Someone said we a=
re being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is
taking place betwee=
n good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literally
(riots, unrest, p=
olitics). If you take the current year 2020 and
divide it by the number 6=
66 (known for its satanic implications) you
will get the number 30330 (re=
peated). This number 30330 happens to be
the number used to vote for Joe =
Biden and Kamala Harris. Freaky?
Supernatural? Odd for sure. Whatever thi=
s means, it doesn=E2=80=99t seem
good to me. First, why would anyone know=
ingly choose those particular
numbers for their campaign? If they weren=
=E2=80=99t knowingly chosen, then
it appears to be a supernatural act by =
the evil one himself and I
would want to change those numbers ASAP. And i=
f the numbers were
chosen knowing their significance, are you satanic? Is=
 this campaign
satanic? Either way I do not believe this is a coincidence=
. And one
thing is certain, 2020 is truly being divided by Satan. He is t=
he
master deceiver and spreader of chaos. Jesus calls him the father of=

lies."
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, and I fo=
und
this information:=C2=A0
If you send a text to that number (at that =
time), you would get a
response asking to support Joe's campaign to take =
down Donald Trump,
with one part in caps saying "CHIP IN >>" pointing to =
a link to go and
donate.
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase in the p=
ast on his twitter and
people believe it is a subliminal message to recei=
ve the mark of the
beast, that is to say the implantable RFID microCHIP t=
hat will go IN
our body.
The scriptures warns us in the last days that =
a false prophet will
rise up doing miracles to deceive many to acquire th=
e beasts mark:
...."Then the beast was captured, and with him the false p=
rophet who
worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who r=
eceived
the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image" (Revelat=
ion
19:20)....
Whatever it takes, DO NOT RECEIVE IT!
"Then a third an=
gel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If
anyone worships the beas=
t and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he=
 himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poure=
d out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormente=
d with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the p=
resence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and e=
ver; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his im=
age, and whoever
receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11).
W=
e are residing in very prophetic times with major Biblical
prophecies com=
ing to pass.
When Donald Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as capital of Israe=
l in
December of 2017, this was a massive step to bring forth the Third=

Temple foretold in the Bible.
God's Holy scriptures warns us that the =
Antichrist will seat himself
in this temple:
"...and the man of sin is =
revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes
and exalts himself above all =
that is called God or that is worshiped,
so that he sits as God in the te=
mple of God, showing himself that he
is God" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).
I=
n the Islamic faith, they have a man called the Mahdi, referred to
as the=
ir messiah who they're eagerly waiting to appear. There are a
number of t=
estimonies from people on the internet who believe this man
will be Barac=
k Obama who may be the biblical Antichrist. I myself have
had strange dre=
ams concerning him. He came on stage declaring himself
to be a follower o=
f Christ with no affiliation to the Muslim religion,
however it was later=
 revealed by his circle of relatives that he
indeed is a faithful Muslim.=

So what's in the name? The meaning of someones name can say a lot
abou=
t a person. God throughout history has given names to people that
have a =
specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? Le=
t us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface...
Jesus says,=
 "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning
from heaven'" (Lu=
ke 10:18).
In Hebrew, the word "Barack" means "lighting", and the use of =
"Bama"
(Strongs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used to refer to the "heights" of=

heaven.
=C2=A0
The day following the election of Barack Obama (11/04=
/08), the
prevailing choose three lotto numbers in Illinois (Obama=
=E2=80=99s domestic
state) for 11/5/08 were 666.
Obama had been U.S. se=
nator for Illinois, and his zip code was 60606.
Regardless, whoever seats=
 himself in the future Third Temple in
Jerusalem, declaring himself to be=
 God IS THE ANTICHRIST. NEVER
FORGET.
Why do we need Jesus?
"for all =
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans
2:23).
"For the=
 wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jes=
us our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
Our good works cannot save our souls from the=
 wrong we've committed.
If we step in front of a judge, being responsible=
 for breaking the
law, the judge will not judge us by the good that we ha=
ve carried out,
rather the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen huma=
nity, created
in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a =
perfect,
righteous, and Holy God?
God has brought down to us His moral =
law's by the 10 commandments
received by Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal =
guidelines were not given
so we can be justified, however so that we coul=
d see the need for a
savior. They're the mirror of God's character of wha=
t He has put in
each of us, with our conscious bearing witness that we kn=
ow that it's
an act of evil to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, and so o=
n.
We may attempt to follow all the moral laws of the 10 commandments,
=
however we'll in no way catch up to them to be justified before a Holy
Go=
d. That same word of the law given to Moses became flesh over 2000
years =
ago in the body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification
by perfe=
ctly fulfilling the law, living a sinless life that solely God
may accomp=
lish.
The gap between us and the law can in no way be reconciled by our=

very own merit, however the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace=

and mercy of God. And if we are to grab on, by faith in Him, He will
p=
ull us forward being the one to justify us. As in the court of law,
if so=
meone steps in and pays your debt, despite the fact that you're
guilty, t=
he judge can do what's legal and just and allow you to go
free. This is w=
hat Jesus did nearly 2000 years ago on the cross. It
was a legal transact=
ion being fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the
shedding of His blood, =
with His last words being, "...It is
finished!..." (John 19:30).
Now wh=
y did Jesus have to die for us?
Due to the fact that God is Holy and just=
, the wrath that belongs to
us could not be overlooked. Through the perfe=
ct righteousness and
justice of God's character, it must be dealt with, i=
t must be quenched
and satisfied.
For God takes no pleasure in the demi=
se of the wicked (Ezekiel
18:23). This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where=
 it speaks of the
coming Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our s=
ins, why it
says it pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.
This is=
 because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon=
 His Son. For if it were to be poured out on us who
deserve it, we would =
all perish and go to hell. God created a way of
escape by pouring it out =
on His Son who's soul could not stay in
Hades, however was raised and sea=
ted at the right hand of God in
power.
Now once we put on the Lord Jesu=
s Christ (Romans 13:14), God no
longer looks at the man or woman who dese=
rves His wrath, but rather
the glorious image of His perfect Son living i=
n our hearts, justifying
us as if we acquired the wrath we deserve, makin=
g a way of escape from
the curse of death.
Now what we must do is turn =
from our sins and believe in the savior,
confessing and forsaking our sin=
s. This is not just a head knowledge
of believing in Jesus, instead recei=
ving His words, taking them to
heart. In which we no longer live to exerc=
ise sin, however turn away
from our sins and exercise righteousness:
"D=
o you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of
God? =
Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, n=
or homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous,
nor drunkards, =
nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom
of God. And such =
were some of you. But you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you w=
ere justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and
by the Spirit of our God"=
 (1 Corinthians 6:9-11).
By doing so we may come to be transformed into t=
he image of God by
faith in His Son Christ Jesus Who's willing to provide=
 the Holy Spirit
to people who ask of Him:
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) s=
ay to you, unless one is born of water
and the Spirit, he cannot enter th=
e kingdom of God. That which is born
of the flesh is flesh, and that whic=
h is born of the Spirit is spirit.
Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You=
 must be born again.' (John
3:5-6).
"But you are not in the flesh but i=
n the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit
of God dwells in you. Now if anyone do=
es not have the Spirit of
Christ, he is not His" (Romans 8:9).
So what =
are you waiting for? Our Father in heaven only wishes the
best for us, re=
storing all the pieces this world has stolen from us.
This is what it mea=
ns to be "holy". To be made whole.
He's ready to hear from you. That God =
given tongue to speak language,
by means of faith, pray to Him, ask Him t=
o forgive you by confessing
your sins and be willing to forsake them; tha=
t you accept the
sacrifice of His Son Jesus on the cross, and that you wa=
nt His Holy
Spirit residing inside you reworking you into a child of the =
living
God.
Jesus says, "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall g=
ive him
(the Holy Spirit) will never thirst. But the water that I shall g=
ive
him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into
everla=
sting life."
Did you know that Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone el=
se in the
Bible, even more than He spoke about heaven?! For this very pur=
pose He
came to die for us, to deliver us from this place that we earned =
by
our sins against a holy God.
=C2=A0
He describes hell as a real pl=
ace where,
"Their worm does not die
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark=
 9:44).
And where,
"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Lu=
ke 13:28).
Jesus tells us who to fear,
"And do not fear those who kill =
the body but cannot kill the soul.
But rather fear Him who is able to des=
troy both soul and body in hell"
(Matthew 10:28).
"Now I saw a new heav=
en and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed a=
way. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jer=
usalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned f=
or her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the=
 tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they sha=
ll be His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God=
 will wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death,=
 nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former thin=
gs have passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make=
 all things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and=
 faithful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega,=
 the
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of=

life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
thi=
ngs, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbe=
lieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, a=
nd all liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and =
brimstone, which is the second death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8).

<body>Hi,<br />
<br />
I want to share a message that has been spreading all over the internet tha=
t concerns the times we are living in. Whether you believe in God or not, t=
his is a must read message!<br />
<br />
We can see throughout time how we have been slowly conditioned to come to t=
his point where we are on the verge of a cashless society. Would it surpris=
e you to know that the Bible foretold of this event? Don't believe me? This=
 may be the most imporant message you will read in these times...please do =
not ignore this!<br />
<br />
This messsage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and the meaning behind=
 counting a number people have been pondering for centuries, 666. This mess=
age also shares why Barack Obama will be the Antichrist as well as the gosp=
el message. This is truly a message from God!<br />
<br />
In the Revelation of Jesus Christ given to the apostle John, we read:<br />
<br />
...."Also he (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles) compels =
all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men a=
nd the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead =
signifying allegiance to the beast, and that no one will be able to buy or =
sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the =
number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let the person who has enough insight c=
alculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his nu=
mber is six hundred and sixty-six" (Revelation 13:16-18 AMP).....<br />
<br />
Referring to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a cashless=
 money society, which we have yet to see, but are heading towards. Why? Rev=
elation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or sell unless we receive the mar=
k of the beast in our right-hand or forehead. We could still buy or sell am=
ong one another without receiving the mark if physical money was still curr=
ency. It logically deduces itself to this reason.<br />
<br />
These verses could not be referring to something spiritual because the word=
 references two different physical locations (our right-hand or forehead) s=
tating the mark will be on one "OR" the other. It once again logically dedu=
ces itself to this reason.<br />
<br />
Here is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how accurat=
e the Bible is concerning the RFID microchip. These are notes from a man na=
med Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help develop this m=
icrochip in the late 1960's.<br />
<br />
Mr. Carl Sanders attended 17 New World Order meetings with heads-of-state o=
fficials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the CIA to talk about the=
ir agenda on how to bring forth this one-world system. The US government co=
mmissioned Carl Sanders to invent a microchip for identifying and controlli=
ng the peoples of the world-a microchip that might be placed underneath the=
 skin with a hypodermic needle (a fast, convenient system that would be gra=
dually accepted by the world).<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders, with a crew of engineers with him, with U.S. grant monies pro=
vided by US tax dollars, took on this project and produced a RFID chip whic=
h is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable by way of the temperature c=
hanges in our skin. With out the knowledge of the holy Bible (Carl Sanders =
was not a believer at the time), these men spent one-and-a-half-million dol=
lars gathering data on the best and most convenient spot to have the RFID c=
hip inserted.<br />
<br />
Guess what? These researchers discovered that the forehead and the back of =
the hand (the two locations Revelation says the mark will go) aren't just t=
he most convenient locations, but are also the only viable locations for co=
nstant, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the lithium =
battery. The RFID chip is approximately 7 millimeters in length, .75 millim=
eters in diameter, about the dimensions of a grain of rice. It's capable of=
 storing pages of information about you. All your standard records, work da=
ta, crime history, health history, and financial information will be saved =
on this chip.<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders believes that this RFID chip, which he remorsefully helped inv=
ent, is the "mark of the beast" spoken about in Revelation 13:16-18. The Gr=
eek word for "mark" is "charagma," which means a "scratch or etching." Addi=
tionally it is fascinating to be aware that the number 666 is a word in the=
 original Greek. This word being "chi xi stigma," with the last part, "stig=
ma," also meaning "to stick or prick. Carl believes this is referencing to =
the usage of a hypodermic needle being poked into a person to insert the RF=
ID chip."<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders asked a Boston Medical Center doctor what would happen if the =
lithium contained within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The docto=
r responded that if the microchip broke inside a human body, the lithium wo=
uld cause a severe and painful wound filled with pus. This is what the scri=
ptures of Revelation 16:2 has to say:<br />
<br />
"So the first angel poured his bowl on the earth, and a nasty and terrible =
sore appeared on the people who had the beast=E2=80=99s mark and worshipped=
 its image" (Revelation 16:2 CEB).<br />
<br />
THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!<br />
<br />
What I first want to mention, before I share what the Holy Spirit has revea=
led to me concerning the number of the beast, is that God confirms in three=
s. We can see this throughout scripture:<br />
<br />
"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and=
 the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to =
the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"...Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" (R=
evelation 4:8 NKJV).<br />
<br />
There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three of the=
m to make the point.<br />
<br />
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first group of three I would like to =
point out is that the mark of the beast is described in three separate vers=
es, 16, 17 and 18.<br />
<br />
The next three I see is in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed by thre=
e contrasting categories of people,<br />
<br />
1 - "both small and great,<br />
2 - rich and poor,<br />
3 - free and slave...".<br />
<br />
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may buy or sell except =
one who has...", followed by three explanations of what one must have to bu=
y or sell,<br />
<br />
1 - "...the mark<br />
2 - or the name of the beast,<br />
3 - or the number of his name".<br />
<br />
Now unto verse 18, we read "Let him who has understanding calculate...", wh=
ich is followed by,=C2=A0<br />
<br />
1 - "the number of the beast,<br />
2 - for it is the number of a man:<br />
3 - His number is 666".<br />
<br />
The last three I see is the number "6" being used three times in a row. The=
 reason I'm making this point about God confirming in three is because it i=
s the key to unlocking how to calculate the number 666.<br />
<br />
Throughout the centuries there have been people trying to calculate numbers=
 based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to identify one p=
erson, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do not see where God is=
 telling us to count up to 666, but rather to count the number of the beast=
. This number is identified as 666. So the verse is telling us to count the=
 number 666.<br />
<br />
What does it mean to count? It means to add up. So how could we add up 666?=
 Remember my previous point about God confirming in threes is key to unlock=
ing the number 666. So logically, what would be the best way to count the n=
umber 666? To count it equally by using the rule of three based off the num=
ber.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back to th=
e start.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no zeroes =
in between or at the end of 666.<br />
<br />
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
What is interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count the numb=
er itself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in Revelation Chapter 13)=
, being the third verse out of the three verses that describe the mark of t=
he beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is 18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D18=
, or 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
Another interesting point is the only two other combinations (making a tota=
l of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" symbol in between 666 a=
re:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.<br />
<br />
Why the number 144 is worth our attention is because the verse following Re=
velation 13:18 is the first time in the Bible where the 144,000 are being d=
escribed in detail:<br />
<br />
"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one=
 hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name written =
on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).<br />
<br />
Now if you add up all three numbers from counting 666 by moving the "+" sym=
bol around, it would be 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about the number=
 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The name of Jesus in G=
reek gematria adds up to 888. The New Testament was originally written in t=
he Greek language. Revelation 14:1 not only mentions the 144,000, but also =
the Lamb who is Jesus.<br />
<br />
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that if you app=
ly the same formula that was used to count 666, you get 8+8+8=3D24. Why the=
 number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are 24 elders seated around=
 the throne of God. This is the same throne where Jesus sits.<br />
<br />
Now if you take:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96<br />
<br />
you get 24+96+96=3D216.<br />
<br />
Take 144,000 divided by 216 and you get 666.<br />
<br />
Remember that this was the same exact formula we used to count the number 6=
66 that ultimately brought forth the number 888.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirms itself as be=
ing the true way to count 666:<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162<br />
<br />
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888<br />
<br />
3: 8+8+8=3D24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216<br />
<br />
4: 144,000 divided by 216=3D666<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is perpetual. And remember that we consistently used a f=
ormula that worked in threes being the number that God uses for confirmatio=
n.<br />
<br />
With making use of the identical method of counting by including the plus s=
ymbol in between the numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a way=
?<br />
<br />
The book of Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various forms. F=
or instance 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is interesting about the=
 number 37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any number that contains the =
same single digit three times in a row, such as 111 to 999, it comes out to=
 the value of if you were to add all three numbers up. For example 888 divi=
ded by 37 equals 24. So 8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+=
6=3D18. Could this be another way of God's word confirming itself that the =
mystery behind calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?<br />
<br />
Another fascinating factor to be aware is that if you add up all the number=
s from 1 to 36 (1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as in three six=
es? May this be a hint that we should add up three sixes instead of perceiv=
ing the number as six-hundred sixty six?<br />
<br />
So what may this mean? Well we know in this world we are recognized by numb=
ers in various forms. From our birth certificates to our social security ca=
rd, also with our drivers license, being recognized founded on a system of =
ruler ship. So it's conceivable that this RFID chip will incorporate a bran=
d new identification that has a complete total of 18 characters.<br />
<br />
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let him calculate the number o=
f the wild beast, number for "of human" it is, and the number of it 666" (R=
evelation 13:1, Greek Translation).<br />
<br />
The Greek word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of hu=
man" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two definitions of th=
e word are "a human being, whether male or female", and, "generically, to i=
nclude all human individuals". Could the number of the beast apply to all m=
ankind?<br />
<br />
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the Greek languag=
e), and other translations, you will notice the beast is described as an "i=
t", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this point is because when a tr=
anslation says "His number is 666", this would imply a singular person, the=
 Antichrist. But by saying "the number of it 666", implies that it is of th=
e beast system as a whole.<br />
<br />
We can know the number of the beast cannot be to identify products (like a =
new barcode) to buy or sell because scripture says we cannot buy or sell wi=
thout the number of the beast. What am I getting at? There will be instance=
s where you could buy something someone made themselves and it wouldn't hav=
e a store branded identification on it. But for this number to be in our ch=
ips, that is where it must be to conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or =
sell without having the number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Rev=
elation 13:18, the number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", de=
finition "generically, to include all human individuals".<br />
<br />
May this be the title of the beast, the number of its name? The one-world b=
east system that is recognized by 18 characters? This might fit the scriptu=
res that speaks of a mark that we must have to buy or sell in our right han=
d or forehead, and that it additionally includes the number of the beast, t=
hroughout a future cashless money society.<br />

"Why did the Biden campaign choose 30330? 2020 divided by 666 =3D 3.0330 Wh=
o believes this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:6 Someone said =
we are being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is taking place betw=
een good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literally (riots, unrest, p=
olitics). If you take the current year 2020 and divide it by the number 666=
 (known for its satanic implications) you will get the number 30330 (repeat=
ed). This number 30330 happens to be the number used to vote for Joe Biden =
and Kamala Harris. Freaky? Supernatural? Odd for sure. Whatever this means,=
 it doesn=E2=80=99t seem good to me. First, why would anyone knowingly choo=
se those particular numbers for their campaign? If they weren=E2=80=99t kno=
wingly chosen, then it appears to be a supernatural act by the evil one him=
self and I would want to change those numbers ASAP. And if the numbers were=
 chosen knowing their significance, are you satanic? Is this campaign satan=
ic? Either way I do not believe this is a coincidence. And one thing is cer=
tain, 2020 is truly being divided by Satan. He is the master deceiver and s=
preader of chaos. Jesus calls him the father of lies."<br />
<br />
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, and I found this inf=
ormation:=C2=A0<br />
<br />
If you send a text to that number (at that time), you would get a response =
asking to support Joe's campaign to take down Donald Trump, with one part i=
n caps saying "CHIP IN >>" pointing to a link to go and donate.<br />
<br />
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase in the past on his twitter and people=
 believe it is a subliminal message to receive the mark of the beast, that =
is to say the implantable RFID microCHIP that will go IN our body.<br />
<br />
The scriptures warns us in the last days that a false prophet will rise up =
doing miracles to deceive many to acquire the beasts mark:<br />
<br />
...."Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked=
 signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who received the mark of=
 the beast and those who worshiped his image" (Revelation 19:20)....<br />
<br />
Whatever it takes, DO NOT RECEIVE IT!<br />
<br />
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone wor=
ships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on =
his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, whic=
h is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be =
tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in=
 the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever a=

image, and whoever receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11).<br =
/>
<br />
We are residing in very prophetic times with major Biblical prophecies comi=
ng to pass.<br />
<br />
When Donald Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as capital of Israel in December o=
f 2017, this was a massive step to bring forth the Third Temple foretold in=
 the Bible.<br />
<br />
God's Holy scriptures warns us that the Antichrist will seat himself in thi=
s temple:<br />
<br />
"...and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and e=
xalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he=
 sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God" (2 Thess=
alonians 2:3-4).<br />
<br />
In the Islamic faith, they have a man called the Mahdi, referred to as thei=
r messiah who they're eagerly waiting to appear. There are a number of test=
imonies from people on the internet who believe this man will be Barack Oba=
ma who may be the biblical Antichrist. I myself have had strange dreams con=
cerning him. He came on stage declaring himself to be a follower of Christ =
with no affiliation to the Muslim religion, however it was later revealed b=
y his circle of relatives that he indeed is a faithful Muslim.<br />
<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someones name can say a lot about a p=
erson. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specifi=
c meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us take=
 a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface...<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from hea=
ven'" (Luke 10:18).<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the word "Barack" means "lighting", and the use of "Bama" (Stron=
gs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used to refer to the "heights" of heaven.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
The day following the election of Barack Obama (11/04/08), the prevailing c=
hoose three lotto numbers in Illinois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic state) for =
11/5/08 were 666.<br />
<br />
Obama had been U.S. senator for Illinois, and his zip code was 60606.<br />
<br />
Regardless, whoever seats himself in the future Third Temple in Jerusalem, =
declaring himself to be God IS THE ANTICHRIST. NEVER FORGET.<br />
<br />
Why do we need Jesus?<br />
<br />
"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 2:23).<br =
/>
<br />
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Chri=
st Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).<br />
<br />
Our good works cannot save our souls from the wrong we've committed. If we =
step in front of a judge, being responsible for breaking the law, the judge=
 will not judge us by the good that we have carried out, rather the crimes =
we have committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's image, pose t=
his type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Holy God?<br /=
>
<br />
God has brought down to us His moral law's by the 10 commandments received =
by Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guidelines were not given so we can be j=
ustified, however so that we could see the need for a savior. They're the m=
irror of God's character of what He has put in each of us, with our conscio=
us bearing witness that we know that it's an act of evil to steal, lie, dis=
honor our parents, and so on.<br />
<br />
We may attempt to follow all the moral laws of the 10 commandments, however=
 we'll in no way catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That s=
ame word of the law given to Moses became flesh over 2000 years ago in the =
body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification by perfectly fulfilli=
ng the law, living a sinless life that solely God may accomplish.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and the law can in no way be reconciled by our very own =
merit, however the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of =
God. And if we are to grab on, by faith in Him, He will pull us forward bei=
ng the one to justify us. As in the court of law, if someone steps in and p=
ays your debt, despite the fact that you're guilty, the judge can do what's=
 legal and just and allow you to go free. This is what Jesus did nearly 200=
0 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being fulfilled in the=
 spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood, with His last words being, "=
...It is finished!..." (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
Now why did Jesus have to die for us?<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that God is Holy and just, the wrath that belongs to us cou=
ld not be overlooked. Through the perfect righteousness and justice of God'=
s character, it must be dealt with, it must be quenched and satisfied.<br /=
>
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the demise of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). This=
 is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His=
 soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it pleased God to crush H=
is only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. For if it were to be poured out on us who deserve it, we wou=
ld all perish and go to hell. God created a way of escape by pouring it out=
 on His Son who's soul could not stay in Hades, however was raised and seat=
ed at the right hand of God in power.<br />
<br />
Now once we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), God no longer look=
s at the man or woman who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image=
 of His perfect Son living in our hearts, justifying us as if we acquired t=
he wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death.<br />
<br />
Now what we must do is turn from our sins and believe in the savior, confes=
sing and forsaking our sins. This is not just a head knowledge of believing=
 in Jesus, instead receiving His words, taking them to heart. In which we n=
o longer live to exercise sin, however turn away from our sins and exercise=
 righteousness:<br />
<br />
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? =
Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor=
 homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor =
revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were s=
ome of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were just=
ified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corint=
hians 6:9-11).<br />
<br />
By doing so we may come to be transformed into the image of God by faith in=
 His Son Christ Jesus Who's willing to provide the Holy Spirit to people wh=
o ask of Him:<br />
<br />
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, unless one is born of water and the =
Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh=
 is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel th=
at I said to you, 'You must be born again.' (John 3:5-6).<br />
<br />
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of Go=
d dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is no=
t His" (Romans 8:9).<br />
<br />
So what are you waiting for? Our Father in heaven only wishes the best for =
us, restoring all the pieces this world has stolen from us. This is what it=
 means to be "holy". To be made whole.<br />
<br />
He's ready to hear from you. That God given tongue to speak language, by me=
ans of faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgive you by confessing your sins a=
nd be willing to forsake them; that you accept the sacrifice of His Son Jes=
us on the cross, and that you want His Holy Spirit residing inside you rewo=
rking you into a child of the living God.<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him (the Hol=
y Spirit) will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will becom=
e in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."<br />
<br />
Did you know that Jesus spoke more about hell than anyone else in the Bible=
, even more than He spoke about heaven?! For this very purpose He came to d=
ie for us, to deliver us from this place that we earned by our sins against=
 a holy God.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
He describes hell as a real place where,<br />
<br />
"Their worm does not die<br />
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44).<br />
<br />
And where,<br />
<br />
"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13:28).<br />
<br />
Jesus tells us who to fear,<br />
<br />
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rath=
er fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:=
28).<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8).<img width=3D"1" height=3D"1" src=3D"http:/=
