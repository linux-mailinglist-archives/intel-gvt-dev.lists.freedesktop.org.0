<B>Attn: My Dear,</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>I am Mrs Alice Bryan, I am a USA citizen 48 years Old. I am from New York, i am thinking of relocating since I am now rich, I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $100,000 while in the United State trying to get my payment all to no avail.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>So I decided to travel to WASHINGTON D.C with all my compensation documents, And I was directed by the ( F B I) Director to contact Mrs. Erelu Angela who is a representative of the ( FB I ) and a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE in Republic of Benin and I contacted her, she explained everything to me. She said whoever is contacting us through emails is fake.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>She took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $30 Million Us Dollars, Moreover, Mrs. Erelu Angela showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payment and I saw your email address as one of the beneficiaries,that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you they are not with your fund, l am advise you to contact Mrs. Erelu Angela. You have to contact her directly on this&nbsp; information below.</B></DIV>

<B>COMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Name: MRS. ERELU ANGELA</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Email: office.f24@aol.com</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>It is not in any way with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.The only money I paid after I met Mrs. Erelu Angela was just $400 for the paperwork. take note of that. Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Mrs. Erelu Angela so that she can help you to Deliver your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kinds of money to complete your transaction.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
