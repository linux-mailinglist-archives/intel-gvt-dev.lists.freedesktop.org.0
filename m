Hi,<br /> <br /> How are things going for you?<br /> Has the presentation
about the drone that was supplied to you earlier today been received?<br />
I'll send you another email about this drone. Thank you for your
understanding.<br /> <br /> On a single charge, the drone's battery lasts
for 30 minutes.<br /> Approximately 1000m of security fence separates the
electrically controlled perimeter from the rest of the property.<br /> The
GPS position is outside the optical flow fixed point, but it is within the
optical flow fixed point during the time of measurement.<br /> Making use
of the power off/on signal, you can return to your place on a low-power
mode.<br /> There are handy capabilities included, such as the MV
(multi-view) mode, one-button return to the home screen, headless mode,
definition switching, gesture photo/video, and the ability to adjust the
front lens up and down. <br /> Wind resistance is rated at an 8. (high wind
resistance)<br /> The fan blades have a diameter of roughly 5.8 cm and are
made of aluminum (in centimeters).<br /> The battery has a capacity of 7.4V
3000mAh when used in conjunction with the board.<br /> A battery's capacity
is critical when dealing with batteries (with charging)<br /> Dimensions of
the drone: When fully unfolded, the finished size is 26x30x5cm (when fully
unfurled).<br /> <br /> Pricing for our drones:<br /> For one drone at
288.50<br /> For two drones at 278.50 each<br /> For three drones at 268.50
each<br /> <br /> Are you interested in receiving one or two? <br /> Send
us the location of your shipment, and we'll get in touch with logistics to
make the preparations for you.<br /><br /><br /><img

a fixed point positioned within the system and GPS positioning located
outside.<br /> The power goes out or you receive a notification suggesting
that the energy has been turned off when you return to your house.<br />
Additionally, this camera includes a virtual reality mode as well as
multi-lens switching, as well as a video/picture panorama and a
video/picture panorama.<br /> Additionally, there are modes, such as MV
(with a single button for returning to the home screen), headless,
photo/video gestures, and front lens adjustment.<br /> When it comes to the
fixed altitude flight system, the GPS/air pressure combination used is a
hybrid of the two technologies.<br /> The level of wind resistance is 8)
for wind resistance.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Mayson Dunlap<br /><br
