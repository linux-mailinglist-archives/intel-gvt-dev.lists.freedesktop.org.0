Hi,<br /> <br /> How would you characterize the current state of
affairs?<br /> Our warehouse currently contains this type of drone for your
use.<br /> I'm going to write up a more in-depth introduction of the
product and give it to you in an email.<br /> <br /> Bullet Points:
&lt;8500 Lumens HD Video Projector&gt;: The projector's brightness is two
to three times that of comparable small projectors sold at the same price.
You may spend the good time with your family or friends at home or outdoors
thanks to the amazingly vivid image it delivers for films and movies, which
has support for resolutions up to 1080P.<br /> <br /> The viewing size of
the projector ranges from 40 inches to 200 inches, and the projection
distance may be adjusted anywhere from 1.2 meters to 6.5 meters. Even
though it has such an impressive projection effect, the design is still
portable, and the size of the body is about the same as that of a diary.<br
/> <br /> 2.4G Wifi Connection &amp; Bluetooth 5.0 Function&gt; Because the
projector includes a bluetooth function, you may connect your preferred
bluetooth speaker to it wirelessly at any time. In addition, the projector
has a 2.4G wifi connection. An ultra-fast 2.4G WiFi connection enables a
streaming experience for online gaming as well as uninterrupted movie
streaming. The function of wireless screen sharing makes it convenient to
stream all of your preferred content from iOS or Android smartphones and
watch it on another screen.<br /> <br /> "Multimedia Connection Support"
refers to the fact that the projector has a number of different
connections, including USB, HDMI, AV, SD, and audio. It is simple to link
it to your smartphone, TV Stick or Box, video game console, personal
computer, tablet, laptop, DVD player, TF card, or USB Sticks.<br /> <br />
All of the company's products are covered by their "Expert After-sales
Services," which includes a 6-month money-back guarantee, a 3-year repair
warranty, and lifetime professional technical assistance. Our goal is to
provide families all over the world with exceptional home theaters and to
provide the world with the best value solutions available for giant-screen
projection. We have high hopes that everyone will soon be able to
appreciate the allure of large screens and projection technologies.<br />
<br /> The cost is 259,90 for a single projector.<br /> For two projectors,
each one will cost 239.90<br /> If you take three or more projectors, the
price drops to 219.90 a piece.<br /> <br /> If we were to give some of our
projectors to you, would you be interested?<br /> Simply provide us with
your location, and we will see to it that the shipping is completed for
you.<br /><br /><img
