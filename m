Hello,<br /><br />I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to
introduce our ebike factory and present our latest product, the pro e-bike.
<br /> Let me provide you with some details about this electric bicycle.<br
/> <br /> Our pro e-bike features a 48 V 13 Ah lithium battery and a
powerful brushless high-speed motor. <br /> With a maximum speed of 45
km/h, it offers a high range of 50 km in pure electric mode and up to 120
km in support mode. <br /> This ensures that you can enjoy long rides
without worrying about running out of power.<br /><br /> The 6061 aluminium
alloy frame further enhances the bike's ability to minimize impact. <br />
The 20 x 4.0-inch wide tires allow you to easily handle any kind of
terrain, no matter how extreme.<br /> <br /> In addition, the pro e-bike
boasts a foldable design. Weighing only 31 kg and capable of holding up to
150 kg, <br /> it can be easily folded by one person thanks to the quick
release system. When folded, it measures a compact 40 x 21 x 33 inches, <br
/> making it convenient to store in the corner of your house or in the
trunk of your car during travels.<br /> <br /> We have our warehouse
located in Germany, shipping to all European countries within 3-7 days. and
it comes 90 percent pre-assembled to facilitate easy assembly. <br /> Our
dedicated customer support team is available round the clock to assist you
with any questions or concerns you may have. <br /> We stand behind the
quality of our e-bike and offer a one-year warranty for motors, batteries,
and controllers. <br /> <br /> To proceed with the purchase, please kindly

information, we will calculate the shipping cost and provide you with the
total price quotation for your purchase.<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />

intelligent LCD display which provides real-time data such as energy,
speed, mileage, power, <br /> and driving time. It automatically controls
the lighting and detects and reports errors immediately. <br /> It even
comes with the ability to adjust to a constant speed on flat terrain and
allows you to charge your phone via USB.<br /> <br /> An outstanding aspect
of the pro e-bike is its unlimited exploration and charging while driving
feature. <br /> Thanks to the long battery life and powerful motor, it is
the perfect choice for outdoor adventures. <br /> Moreover, you can
recharge the battery while pedaling, enabling you to keep going even when
