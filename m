Hello,

My name is Horst Angerer, we are unfamiliar with each other, I am a senior =
account manager with Santander Bank Great Britian. I have worked here for a=
 little more than 20 years now and I would like to present a profitable bus=
iness deal to you. I am presenting this deal to you because you are very im=
portant to this deal as you will find out.

I was the personal accountant to one of our late customers, a foreign contr=
actor with Royal Dutch plc who has an investment account with my bank. He l=
ost his life in a car crash in 2013.  He died without leaving a will. Sever=
al efforts were made to find his extended family through his embassy withou=
t success. I received a notice last week to provide the next of kin because=
 i am his accountant or the account will be closed in 14 days time. I am co=
ntacting you to apply for the money left behind because you have the same l=
ast name as my client. This will be done legally respecting UK laws and suc=
cess is guaranteed if we cooperate on this. The bank will release the accou=
nt to you because of your last name and my recommendation of you as the nex=
t of kin. I am a very religious person and I cannot lie; I expect the same =
from you.

I propose we share the proceeds 50:50, I think this is fair. I will give yo=
u all the necessary information about the deal when I get your response.

Please get back to me as soon as you can for further discussion.

Warm regards,
Horst
