 Dear Friend,

I am writing this message from my hospital bed, I am Mrs. Therese Koga; 49
yrs old widow, from Burkina Faso, married to Late Dr. Patrick Koga, the
chairman of High River Gold Mines Ltd Burkina Faso West Africa. Meanwhile,
I decided to contact you because of my health condition, I am having
diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Having knowing my condition with a new
chapter in my life, I decided to donate a sum Twenty-Five Million Two
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only ($25,200,000.00 ) to Charity
Organizations or Christian individuals to support the Orphans, Motherless
Babies, Less privileged and free Medical & Medicine Poor People's around
the World.  I need a reliable person who will handle this project
accordingly, that's why I'm taking this decision to contact you to help and
carry out this Godly project. Please all I need from you is trust and
sincere to utilize this fund as I instructed here. I will give you more
information on how the fund will be transferred from my bank to your
account over there in your country. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Regards
Mrs.Therese Koga assume that this message will reach you in good health.
Though I did not know you in person or having seen you before, due to the
reliable revelation, I decided to share this lucrative opportunity with
you, so kindly consider this message as vital, believing that you will
never regret anything in the end. My name is Mrs.Therese Koga  from Burkina
Faso and I am married to Dr. Patrick Koga, director High River Gold Mines
Ltd Burkina Faso West Africa. Thus, my late Husband deposited the sum of
$25.200.000.00 United states dollars with the Halifax bank of London before
his death and, it's just my urgent need for foreign partner that made me
contact you for this transaction for investment. I assured you honesty and
reliability to champion this transaction hence you are ready to handle this
transaction and I will guide you on how you should apply for the claim.
After the successful transfer of the transfer fund into your account,

 I will come over to your country for investment, while the money will be
shared between us in the ratio of 70/30%. Further details of the transfer
will be forwarded to you if you are ready to assist me.

Your friend.

Mrs. Therese Koga
