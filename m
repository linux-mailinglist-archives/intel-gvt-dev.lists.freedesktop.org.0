do you mean we need to name it as vfio_migration, e.g.
 /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:02.0/UUID1/vfio_migration ?

the device_type is to indicate below device_id is a pci id.

yes, include a device_api field is better.
for mdev, "device_type=vfio-mdev", is it right?

it's parent pci id for mdev actually.

non-mdev can opt to not include this field, or as you said below, a
vendor signature.

yes, pv_mode and aggregator are vendor specific fields.
but they are important to decide whether two devices are compatible.
pv_mode means whether a vGPU supports guest paravirtualized api.
"none+ppgtt+context" means guest can not use pv, or use ppgtt mode pv or
use context mode pv.

> 
yes, <major>.<minor>[.bugfix] scheme may be better, but I'm not sure if
it works for a complicated scenario.
e.g for pv_mode,
(1) initially,  pv_mode is not supported, so it's pv_mode=none, it's 0.0.0,
(2) then, pv_mode=ppgtt is supported, pv_mode="none+ppgtt", it's 0.1.0,
indicating pv_mode=none can migrate to pv_mode="none+ppgtt", but not vice versa.
(3) later, pv_mode=context is also supported,
pv_mode="none+ppgtt+context", so it's 0.2.0.

But if later, pv_mode=ppgtt is removed. pv_mode="none+context", how to
name its version? "none+ppgtt" (0.1.0) is not compatible to
"none+context", but "none+ppgtt+context" (0.2.0) is compatible to
"none+context".

Maintain such scheme is painful to vendor driver.

yes, it's indicating that it's compatible with any of these.
Sean's version proposal may also work, but it would be painful for
vendor driver to maintain the versions when multiple similar features
are involved.

actually it can be merged with the previous one :)
But I guess there must be one that cannot merge, so put it as an
example to demo multiple COMPATIBLE objects.
