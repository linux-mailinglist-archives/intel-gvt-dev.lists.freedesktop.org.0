My name is Reem Hashimy, the Emirates Minister of State and the Managing Director of the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) World Expo 2020 Committee which has been postponed to start from October 2021 to March 2022 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</DIV>
<DIV>
I am writing to you to manage the funds I received as financial gratification from various foreign companies I assisted to participate in the coming event. This is because I can not personally manage the fund in my country because of the sensitive nature of my office and other restrictions around me.</DIV>
<DIV>
For this reason, I have an agreement with a consultant to keep the funds in an&nbsp; account with a foreign bank where it will be possible to instruct the transfer of ownership right&nbsp; to a third party for investment purpose; which is the reason I am contacting you to receive and manage the funds as my investment partner.</DIV>
<DIV>
On your indication of interest; I will instruct the consultant to process the fund to your country for investment purposes.</DIV>
<DIV>
Regards.</DIV>
<DIV>
Reem Hashimy.</DIV>
