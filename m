<p>Hi,<br /> <br /> Hope you are doing well.<br /> Our company recently
launched the below office chair with mutiple colors to choose from.<br />
Black, white, blue, grey, green, red, pink, purple, and cyan are among the
chair colors available.<br /> You can check it through the following
product information.<br /> <br /> Foam with a high density, which is more
comfortable, elastic, resilient, and long-lasting. 1.8% thicker, more
stable and robust steel frame. <br />Skin and wear are not affected by its
smooth, non-abrasive surface.<br /> Lifts up to 300 lbs. with this device.
The gas lift configuration for class 3 has been improved.<br /> <br />
Tests were conducted on a rubber roller that rolls quietly for 1,000
kilometers.<br /> Rotating rollers that can move in multiple directions and
rotate 360 degrees, max.<br /> Its weight limit is 300 pounds. Users can
recline their chairs using this feature. From 90 to 180 degrees, the user
can recline the chair. <br />Changing the knob under the seat causes the
chair to bounce.<br /> <br /> 22.5 cm on the front and 30.5 cm on the rear
are the dimensions. It is possible to choose between 14" and 20" wide
seats.<br /> It is possible to adjust the seat's height from 17.3 inches up
to 21.5 inches.<br /> It's perfect for playing computer games, watching TV,
working, and relaxing, among other activities.<br /> As a result, your
living room or bedroom will be revitalized.<br /> <br /> The cost of each
chair is 195.90 each.<br /> A pair of chairs costs 185.90 each.<br /> Three
or more chairs cost 175.90 each.<br /> <br /> Do you consider to receive
one or two of our chairs for yourself? We need your location for

supported. You will find a natural body form in our seats.<br /> With its
pu leather furniture, this home provides maximum comfort.<br />
Specification:<br /> It is possible to adjust the locking mechanism's angle
between 90 and 180 degrees. Height can be adjusted for the spring
cylinder<br /> This is a five-star foundation when it comes to toughness
and durability.<br /> In the design process, orthopaedic and ergonomic
considerations are given top priority.<br /> A premium leather, pu leather
is made from pigskin.<br /> Chair's headrest and lumbar coils are covered
by its price.<br /> Weight capacity is 300 pounds.<br /> Size of the
backrest: 22.5 x 30 inches<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> George Kaur<br /><br
