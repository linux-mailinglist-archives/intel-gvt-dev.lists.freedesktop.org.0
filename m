Hello,

My name is Mr. Kong Kea, an accountant in our branch office here. A deceased client of mine, business man and also own a gold Mining Company/sales, who bears the same name as yours, died along with his family many years ago without a WILL or next of kin.

He had a fixed deposit valued at the sum huge of money left behind before he met his end. I contacted you so that I can present you as my late client next of kin, so that the money can be transferred to your account, and we will share the funds equally, 50/50% to both parties.

Regards,
Mr. Kong
