e what I have just been saying When we are sleeping naturally it is not nec=
essary to believe as has often been supposed that our senses are closed to =
external sensations Our senses continue to be active They act it is true wi=
th less precision but in compensation they embrace a host of subjective imp=
ressions which pass unperceived when we are awake?for then we live in a wor=
ld of perceptions common to all men?and which reappear in sleep when we liv=
e only for ourselves Thus our faculty of sense perception far from being na=
rrowed during sleep at all points is on the contrary extended at least in c=
ertain directions in its field of operations It is true that it often loses=
 in energy in tension what it gains in extension It brings to us only confu=
sed impressions These impressions are the materials of our dreams But they =
are only the materials they do not suffice to produce them 29<br /> <br /> =
They do not suffice to produce them because they are vague and indeterminat=
e To speak only of those that play the principal rle the changing colors an=
d forms which deploy before us when our eyes are closed never have welldefi=
ned contours Here are black lines upon a white background They may represen=
t to the dreamer the page of a book or the facade of a new house with dark =
blinds or any number of other things Who will choose What is the form that =
will imprint its decision upon the indecision of this material This form is=
 our memory<br /> <br /> Let us note first that the dream in general create=
s nothing Doubtless there may be cited some examples of artistic literary a=
nd scientific production in dreams I will recall only the wellknown anecdot=
e told of Tartini a violinistcomposer of the eighteenth century As he was t=
rying to compose a sonata and the muse remained recalcitrant he went to sle=
ep and he saw in a dream the devil who seized his violin and played with ma=
ster hand the desired sonata Tartini wrote it out from memory when he 30 wo=
ke It has come to us under the name of The Devil's Sonata But it is very di=
fficult in regard to such old cases to distinguish between history and lege=
nd We should have autoobservations of certain authenticity Now I have not b=
een able to find anything more than that of the contemporary English noveli=
st Stevenson In a very curious essay entitled A Chapter on Dreams this auth=
or who is endowed with a rare talent for analysis explains to us how the mo=
st original of his stories have been composed or at least sketched in dream=
s But read the chapter carefully You will see that at a certain time in his=
 life Stevenson had come to be in an habitual psychical state where it was =
very hard for him to say whether he was sleeping or waking That appears to =
me to be the truth When the mind creates I would say when it is capable of =
giving the effort of organization and synthesis which is necessary to trium=
ph over a certain difficulty to solve a problem to produce a living work of=
 the imagination we are not really asleep or at least that 31 part of ourse=
lves which labors is not the same as that which sleeps We cannot say then t=
hat it is a dream In sleep properly speaking in sleep which absorbs our who=
le personality it is memories and only memories which weave the web of our<=
br /> <br /> dreams But often we do not recognize them They may be very old=
 memories forgotten during waking hours drawn from the most obscure depths =
of our past they may be often are memories of objects that we have perceive=
d distractedly almost unconsciously while awake Or they may be fragments of=
 broken memories which have been picked up here and there and mingled by ch=
ance composing an incoherent and unrecognizable whole Before these bizarre =
assemblages of images which present no plausible significance our intellige=
nce which is far from surrendering the reasoning faculty during sleep as ha=
s been asserted seeks an explanation tries to fill the lacun&aelig; It fill=
s them by calling up other memories which presenting themselves often with =
the same deformations and the same incoherences as 32 the preceding demand =
in their turn a new explanation and so on indefinitely But I do not insist =
upon this point for the moment It is sufficient for me to say in order to a=
nswer the question which I have propounded that the formative power of the =
materials furnished to the dream by the different senses the power which co=
nverts into precise determined objects the vague and indistinct sensations =
that the dreamer receives from his eyes his ears and the whole surface and =
interior of his body is the memory</strong><br /> <br /> <span title="quantifying"><small></span></small><style title="quintillion"><span><font size="orients"></font></span><span dir="cannibal"><font></font></style><font size="Tiburon"></span></font></p>=
