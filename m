Hi,
<p>How are you doing?<br /> Have you received the introduction on the
foosball table that we supplied to you from last week? <br /> I'm going to
send you the this email once more through this channel.<br /> <br /> On a
single table, there can be up to 22 players, two scouts, a green
playground, and two manual scorers working simultaneously.<br /> Because of
the suppleness of the rod bars, it has no trouble handling the ball. There
are two balls provided. (There are two balls included in the package.)<br
/> Our football table is constructed of high-quality MDF fiberboard.<br />
The Game Tables can be assembled in a short amount of time if the
instructions are followed and the clearly numbered components are used.<br
/> Because of its natural wood-like appearance, this table may be used in
any playroom or spare room.<br /> You have a viable alternative in front of
you.<br /> The dimensions are 121.92 cm x 77.5 cm x 60 cm. MDF (Carb P2),
iron, wood color, plastic color frame, and wood color leg are the materials
used (L x W x H)<br /> There are 21.5 kg in total weight of the set (47.40
pounds).<br /> <br /> Pricing:<br /> For one foosball table, 259.50<br />
For two foosball tables, 239.50 each<br /> Three or more foosball tables
are available at 219.50 each<br /> <br /> Would you be interested in taking
some of our tables?<br /> Just inform us your location, and we will take
care of shipment for you.</p>

width="360" height="400" /><br /><br /><br />Real soccer fields have been
restored, as well as a playable table with 22 players and two manual
scorers.<br /> Design-friendly: The race will have two cup holders, which
will allow runners to stay hydrated throughout the course. <br />To avoid
slipping on rod bars and increase ball control, soft grips are utilized on
the rods (2 balls included) A pair of balls is included in the price of the
product.<br /> It's made of MDF fiberboard, which is a durable and quality
material that will last for years.<br /> It is supported by four robust
legs that give a stable and adjustable slip basis for each of its four
legs, respectively.<br /> Using a few simple procedures and components that
are clearly labeled, you may construct your very own custom-designed game
table.<br /><br />Pricing:<br />For one foosball table, 259.50<br />For two
foosball tables, 239.50 each<br />Three or more foosball tables are
available at 219.50 each<br /><br />Would you be interested in taking some
of our tables?<br />Just inform us your location, and we will take care of
shipment for you.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Charlie Haynes<br /><br /><br
