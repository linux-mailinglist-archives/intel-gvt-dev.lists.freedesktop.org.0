Dear Supporter,

People in Ukraine are in grave danger of physical harm. Over Five Million h=
ave fled their homes seeking refuge in neighbouring countries and others ar=
e stuck in Ukraine, sheltering from Heavy Shelling and bombardments in majo=
r cities. =


Normal working life has been forced to stop. Ukrainian member organisations=
 like ours, are providing support to families who desperately need assistan=
ce. We have few people who are putting themselves at high risk of distribut=
ing domestic items to people hiding in bunkers. Trade unions in neighbourin=
g countries including Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova are su=
pporting the increasing number of refugees. =


Every morning, we get an extremely long list of peoples' needs from differe=
nt quarters. We have to assemble the items and provide them to our people t=
hrough highly secure but risky means.

People need:

** Bunker illuminators
** Food and water provisions
** Groceries
** Medical supplies
** Hygiene items

The situation of our women and children in several accommodating countries =
is not easy. Worst still, our front line soldiers need your help, not just =
by monitoring war situation but to be concerned and more financially involv=
ed.

You can help Ukraine workers and their families by donating to this emergen=
cy fundraising appeal. Also, support the brave soldiers on the frontline.

We can receive your donations in the ways mentioned below:

Receiving donations through Bitcoin  has made great impact so far. =


Donations from =A320 to =A3500 are received through Bitcoin wallet:

BTC - bc1qq852vf4l8vy6j90zauva5hg0crnww6vgpgwtcm

Donations above =A3500 are sent via Western Union, MoneyGram or RIA to the =
information below and transaction slip sent to us by email.

Receiver's name: Jonathan Stevens
Receiver's Address: 377 The Crescent
London - E43 9XL - United Kingdom

Donations above =A31,000 are by wire transfer. We provide bank coordinates =
for such donations.

All funds donated are shared to Two Organisations. One in Ukraine that supp=
orts the humanitarian work for stranded people and organisations in neighbo=
uring countries supporting refugees.

The people of Ukraine are grateful for support and donations from you and o=
ther supporters as we protect our freedom.

Your donation will certainly contribute to Ukrainian victory as well as sup=
port civil people. We will win as the best people are with us.

Thank you.
