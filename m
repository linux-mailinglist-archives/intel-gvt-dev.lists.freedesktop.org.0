Greetings

My name is Mrs. Tiril Freydis Brundtland I=E2=80=99m from Norway I need you=
r
assistance for a charity work, I am sending you this message with heavy
tears in my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, and also praying that it
will reach you in good health, as I am suffering from long time cancer, I
was once married to my husband late Mr. Jo Benkow Brundtland a politician
who die in the year 2013 owns a small Oil company in South Korea, when he
was alive he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC8,500,000 Eight million, Five hu=
ndred
thousand Euros in a bank in Brussels the capital city of Belgium in Europe
The money was from the sale of his company and death benefits payment and
entitlements of my deceased husband by his company.

I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless
babies/Less privileged/Widows, as I am dying and diagnosed with cancer
about 3 years ago. I have decided to donate from what I have inherited from
my late husband to you for the good work of Almighty God; I will be going
in for an operation surgery soon, I need your urgent answer to know if you
will be able to execute this project, and I will give you more information
on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.

Thanks
Mrs. Tiril Freydis Brundtland
