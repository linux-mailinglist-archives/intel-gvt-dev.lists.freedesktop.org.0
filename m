Got you. I thought aggregation is special since it is purely about linear
resource adjustment w/o changing the feature set of the instance, thus
reasonable to get special handling in management stack which needs
to understand this attribute anyway. But I agree that it's difficult to 
predict the future and other special cases...

If exhaustive search can be done just one-off to build the compatibility
database for all assignable devices on each node, then it might be
still tenable in datacenter?

I suppose a compatibility list like this doesn't require the existing device
to update. It should be new device's compatibility to claim compatibility
to the types carried in existing list.

This makes some sense, since anyway 'aggregation' still changes how the
instance looks like. But let me understand clearly. Are you proposing 
actually moving 'aggregation' to be a vendor attribute (i.e. removing
the 'mdev' sub-directy in this patch), or more about a policy of treating
it as a vendor attribute? If the former, is there any problem of having
Libvirt manage this attribute given that it becomes vendor specific now?

Thanks
Kevin
