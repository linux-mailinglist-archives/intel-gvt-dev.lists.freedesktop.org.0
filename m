<p><font face="Arial">Attn: Dear friend,<br>
<br>
<br>
My quest to locate a responsible friend and partner to bring my dreams to a 
reality,<br>
hence I took this bold step to contact you through this medium and I would not 
like<br>
you to take an offense that I am bothering you since you do not know me neither 
have<br>
we met before.<br>
<br>
I am Mrs. Naomi Robert from Jordan; I am married to Dr. Alan Robert who worked 
with<br>
the Jordan embassy in Canada for nine years,before he died in the year 2015. We 
were<br>
both married for seventeen years without a child. He died after a brief illness 
that<br>
lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both involved in charity 
services.<br>
Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial 
home<br>
which is against my principle.<br>
<br>
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $13.5 Million (Thirteen 
Million<br>
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). This money is still invested in one of the 
Bank in<br>
Canada. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three 
months due<br>
to my cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having 
known<br>
my condition of health I have decided to donate this fund to Charity, Orphanage 
or an<br>
individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here.<br>
I want an individual that will use these money to fund Charity, Orphanages and 
Widows<br>
and also ensure that these set of people are well maintained.<br>
<br>
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money 
and my<br>
husband's relatives are well off and I don't want my husband's hard earned money 
to be<br>
misused by them. As I do not want a situation whereby this money will be used in 
an<br>
ungodly manner, hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid 
of<br>
death because I lived a fulfilled life.<br>
<br>
As it is right now, I don't need any telephone communication in this regard 
because of<br>
my health and also due to the presence of my husband's relatives around me 
always.<br>
I don't want them to know about this development; as soon as I receive your 
reply I<br>
shall give you the contact of my husband's account officer.<br>
<br>
I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the 
original-beneficiary<br>
of this said fund. I want you to see to the needs of the less privileged. My 
happiness is<br>
that I lived a fulfilled life and I don’t have any regrets in life. Please note 
that any<br>
delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another individual as I 
stated herein.<br>
<br>
Do get back to me via this my private email address: <b>naomirobert411@yahoo.com</b>.<br>
Kindly notify your interest to help me assist charity; hoping to hear from you 
soonest <br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
Mrs. Naomi Robert</font></p>
