My name is Reem Hashimy, the Emirates Minister of State and Managing Direct=
or of the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) World Expo 2020 Committee which was =
postponed from 2020 to October 2021 to March 2022 because of the Covid-19 p=
andemic.

I am writing to you to manage the funds I received as financial gratificati=
on from various foreign companies I assisted to participate in the event th=
at is taking place as we speak. The amount is $44,762,906.00 United States =
dollars. But I can not personally manage the fund in my country because of =
the sensitive nature of my office and the certain restriction on married Mu=
slim women.

For this reason, an agreement was reached with the various firms to direct =
the financial gifts to an account with a financial institution where it wil=
l be possible for me to instruct the transfer of the fund to a third party =
for investment purpose; which is the reason I am contacting you to receive =
the fund and manage it as my investment partner. Note that the fund is NOT =
connected to any criminal or terrorist activity.

On your indication of interest with your information; I will instruct the f=
inancial institution to process the fund to your country for investment pur=
poses.

Regards.
Reem Hashimy.
