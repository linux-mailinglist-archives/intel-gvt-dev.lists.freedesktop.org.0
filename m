You hereby inform of the attached alleged court order against your

Internet into a
juvenile pornographic movie cyber.The Indian Intelligence Bureau works 
in partnership with the Police Cybercrime Special Units in handling all 
complex and sensitive cases of cyber crimes, especially when the victims 
are women and minor children.

Our laboratories are equipped with crawling digital software, having 
forensic capabilities such as extraction of deleted data from hard disks 
and mobile phones, imaging and hash value calculation, forensic servers 
and portable forensic tools for on-site examination, facility to extract 
data from latest Android or IOS as well as Chinese phones.

Based on the above, it is extremely difficult for any victim to 
consciously or unconsciously visit juvenile pornographic sites without 
being digitally captured. More information or clarification on the court 
order will be made available to you upon receipt of your response within 
24 hours; our office operates 24 hours / 5 days.
