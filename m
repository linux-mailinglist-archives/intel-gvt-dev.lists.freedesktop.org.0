<BR>
Series of meetings have been held over the past 7 months with the secretary=
-general of the United States Organization, which ended Three(3) days ago. =
You have not received your funds to the tune amount of $2,800.000.00 due to=
 past corrupt Governmental Officials who almost held the fund to themselves=
 for their selfish reason(s) and some people who have taken advantage of yo=
ur funds all in an attempt to swindle away with your funds which have led t=
o so many losses from your end and unnecessary=20
delay in the receipt of your funds.<BR><BR>
The INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) enhanced by the United States and Fed=
eral Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the curr=
ent president of the United States, his Excellency President&nbsp;Joe Biden=
&nbsp;to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and o=
ther people and organizations who have been found not to have received thei=
r Contract Sum, Lottery/Gambling, Inheritance, and the likes. Please be req=
uired to make an option on how you would like to=20
receive your payment, Because there are two(2) methods of payment available=
 to you, which is either by Certified Cashier's Check or by ATM card delive=
ry?<BR><BR>
ATM Card: We will be issuing you a custom pin-based ATM card which you will=
 be able to make use of to withdraw up to $12,000.00 per day from any Autom=
ated Teller Machine that has the Master Card Logo on it. Also with the ATM =
card, you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. T=
he ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to u=
se it. Even if you do not have a bank account.<BR><BR>
Certified Cashier's Check: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleare=
d within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of y=
our preferred options and would be mailed to you via FedEx. Because we have=
 signed a contract with FedEx Express which should expire by the end of nex=
t month, you will only be required to pay the sum of $450 instead of $680 s=
aving you $230 So if you pay before the end of this month you save $230 Tak=
e note that anyone asking you for money above the=20
usual fee is aligned to fraudulent activity and you will have to stop commu=
nicating with every other person if you have been in contact with any. Also=
, remember that all you will ever have to spend is $450.00 and nothing more=
! Nothing less! And we guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfull=
y delivered to you within the next 48 hours after the receipt of payment ha=
s been confirmed.<BR><BR>
N.B: Everything has been taken care of by the United States Government and =
the Federal Bureau of Investigations which includes IRS taxes, custom paper=
, and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $450.<BR><BR>
DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fee for shippin=
g your ATM card/Cashiers Check is $680 but because we have signed a contrac=
t with FedEx for bulk shipping which makes the fees reduced from the actual=
 fee of $680 to $450, nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort!<BR><BR>T=
