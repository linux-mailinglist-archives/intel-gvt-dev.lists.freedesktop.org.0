Hello

My name is   Mark Miller, I’m currently hospitalized in a private hospital as a result of cancer. My purpose of writing to you is for a charity project with the funds that I have in my private saved Deposit. It is clear that I’m approaching the last days of my life according to the doctor. I’m offering a sum Amount ($2.850,000.00 USD to any trustworthy person/ organization that will invest the fund wisely into profitable business ventures and donate part of the profit earned annually to charity worldwide; I am helpless to do so as a result of my health, I urge you to help me fulfill my last wish. As soon as I receive your positive response, I will detail and also direct you on what to do.

Sincerely,
Mark Miller
