Good day,
                                             
       I am Edward Kenneth Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service 
Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in  San Diego 
International Airport 3225N Harbor Dr, San Diego CA92101, United States 
California. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment 
through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF 
Kennedy Airport to our facility here in California, and when scanned it 
revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing 
approximately 130kg.


      The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly 
declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal 
effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent 
or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to 
pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the 
consignment is delayed and abandoned.


      By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $4M  which is total of 
$8Million USD. They are  still left in the airport storage facility till 
today. The Consignments like I said are two  metal trunk boxes weighing 
about 65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective 
capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including 
your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in 
London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified 
document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to 
reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I  can cross-check 
and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now 
left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us 
repatriate it back to UK
(place of origin) as we were instructed.

     As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most 
importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the 
yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I 
am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages 
provided you will also give me something  out of it (financial 
gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services 
of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the  
necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep 
or the  destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get 
from  you before I can get involved in this project.


Best Regards,

Edwar kenneth
Head Officer-in-Charge
Administrative Service Inspection Unit.
