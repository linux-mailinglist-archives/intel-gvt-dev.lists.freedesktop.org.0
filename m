Hi,<br /> <br /> How are things going at the moment?<br /> This drone is
available in our warehouse.<br /> I'll send you an email with more specific
introduction about the product.<br /> <br /> Level 7 wind resistance.<br />
Flight accuracy can be improved by using GPS positioning mode during the
flight.<br /> The distance between two 5G wifi fpv networks can be up to
2000 meters.<br /> Keep up with me: The plane will maintain a fixed
position over the phone and will move in the same direction as the
operator..<br /> The plane will fly in circles as a result of the orbital
motion, which will provide a cooler shooting viewpoint.<br /> In order to
use gesture recognition for photography, you must be within 1-3 meters of
the aircraft and make a gesture at the camera.<br /> In waypoint flight
mode, all you have to do is sketch a route on the screen and the helicopter
will follow it.<br /> With the auto-return function enabled. When the
aircraft loses contact with the controller, the aircraft will return to the
takeoff location <br />using the GPS trajectory as a navigation aid.<br />
The flight time is up to 28 minutes when using a 11.4V 2850mAh battery.<br
/> In headless mode, there is no need to modify the aircraft's position
before take-off.<br /> With the one-click back option, you may effortlessly
get back on track.<br /> Takeoff and landing are accomplished with a single
click. With a single button press, the drone will take off or return to the
take-off <br />position autonomously, saving you time and effort.<br />
Overcurrent prevention is included with low power protection.<br /> You can
fly up, down, forward, backward, left, and right using the six channels
available.<br /> A six-axis gyroscope provides more stable flight and
easier control than previous models.<br /> High-strength technical plastics
are used in the construction of the quadrotor fuselage, which makes it both
lightweight and durable.<br /> Pictures can be accompanied by music and
video for sharing: When it comes to images, you can choose to share one or
numerous photos, <br />however videos can only be shared one at a time.<br
/> <br /> Pricing:<br /> For one drone at 288.90<br /> For two drones at
268.90 each<br /> For three drones at 258.90 each<br /> <br /> Would you be
interested in receiving one or two of our drones?<br /> We will need your
location to ship the drone to you.<br /> In addition, we will make contact
with logistics to make arrangements for the shipment.<br /><br /><br /><img

distance of 2000m<br /> 6K wide-angle adjustable camera with two-axis
mechanical stabilization and 120 degrees of rotation. <br />6CH is the
channel number for the ESC camera.<br /> Lithium-ion battery with a voltage
of 11.4V and a capacity of 2850mAh (included)<br /> Battery for the
transmitter is a rechargeable lithium battery.<br /> Flight duration is 28

Dimensions of a quadrilateral:<br /> Product folding dimensions (in
centimeters): 17x11.5x6.7cm<br /> Product development dimensions (in
centimeters): 26x26x6.7cm<br /> <br />Would you be interested in receiving
one or two of our drones?<br />We will need your location to ship the drone
