My Name is Mrs. Kathleen DeFays, from Belgium. I know that this message
 will be a surprise to you. Firstly, I married my late husband for thirty
 years without a child, and my husband died in a fatal motor accident.
Since his death I decided not to marry again because of my age and
unfortunately we  don't have a child, my doctor confided in me that I have
less chances to  live.


My late husband was A gold merchant who owned a small gold Mine in Dubai;
During his lifetime he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 8.5 Million Euros) Ei=
ght
million, Five hundred thousand Euros in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital
city of Burkina Faso in West Africa. The deposited money was from the sale
 of the shares, death benefits payment and entitlements of my deceased
 husband by his company. Because my late husband was one of the first
people to discover a large quantity of gold in Burkina Faso when buying
from a French company there.

I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in good
health, since I am not in good health in which I sleep every night without
knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I have been suffering from
cancer for a long time and presently I am partially suffering from a stroke
illness which has become almost impossible for me to move around. I decided
 to contact you to claim the fund since I don't have any relation, I grew
up from the orphanage home,

I have decided to donate what remains to you for the support of helping
Motherless babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and diagnosed
with cancer about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God Almighty to
donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for the good
work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to forgive me and believe
 he has, because He is a Merciful God, I will be going in for an operation
 soon.

This is the reason I need your services to stand as my next of kin or an
executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money remains
unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the government will take
the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for what I don=E2=80=99t know,=
 as
 everyone knows in that country is terrorist
attack and military  coup, so it is a risk  keeping the fund there when I
don=E2=80=99t have any hope to live.

So  I will instruct the bank to transfer this fund to you as a foreigner
 but you have to promise me that you will take 40% of the total money for
 your personal use While 60% of the money will go to charity, Orphanage and
 less Privileges"  and helping the Needy. I grew up as an Orphan and I
don't  have anybody as my family member, just to ensure that the house of
God is  maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and
accept my soul because this
sickness has suffered me so much.

I need your urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute this
project, and I will give you more information on how the funds will be
transferred to your bank account.

Thanks,
Mrs. Kathleen DeFays.
