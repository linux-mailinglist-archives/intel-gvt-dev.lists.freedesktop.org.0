Dear Friend,
 =

My sincere apologies for this unsolicited email to you, my name is Barriste=
r Miguel Felipe Nesto. We consult for (NGOs) and Companies on Family Law, I=
ntellectual Property, Real Estate, Wills, Trusts and Taxes.
 =

I am consulting you on business grounds as my deceased client Mr. Frank, wh=
om I have personally worked with for many years died as a result of a heart=
-related condition on March 12TH 2021, his heart condition was due to the l=
ost of all members of his family during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020. He l=
eft behind the sum of (10,700,000.00 Euro) Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousa=
nd Euros, with a Local Bank here in Spain. This deposit has lasted more tha=
n expected period in the Local Bank Security vault, and because of the refo=
rms in Spain and within European financial system after COVID-19 Pandemic. =
The Local Bank has notified me to introduce a beneficiary or a benefactor o=
f Mr. Frank deposit, failure to respond to this ultimatum would legally all=
ow the Local Bank to confiscate this deposit as unclaimed due to the ongoin=
g financial reforms.
 =

After several researches so far to get hold of someone related to him has p=
roved abortive, as he did not declare any person address, partner or relati=
ve in the official paper, which made it difficult for me to locate any. My =
late client deposit cannot be release unless I introduce someone details to=
 the Local Bank as Next of Kin or relative as indicated in their guidelines=
. So since you share the same last name with Mr. Frank, I am actually askin=
g for your consent to present your information to these Local Bank as the o=
fficial beneficiary or a benefactor to this deposit so that the proceeds of=
 this deposit will be release to you if approved.
 =

I would suggest 20% of this money to be shared among Charity Organizations =
while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. The deposit does not =
contain any criminal origin, the procedure will be impeccable without any c=
omplication and the process will be completed on the right time. I shall pr=
ovide all the legal requested documents that may be requires for these proc=
edures. All I require from you is your trust and good cooperation.
 =

I am convinced that this is 100% risk free, that you should not entertain a=
ny atom of fear. The fact is that I just don=E2=80=99t want my late client =
deposit to be declared as unclaimed by the management of the Local Bank or =
confiscated by the government as a result of the financial reform.
 =

Note: If my approach offends your moral ethics do accept my sincere apology=
, if on the contrary you wish to work with me on this, kindly get back to m=
e with your interest for more details on my direct private contact below:
