Dear Beneficiary, Contact email</DIV>

<DIV>
We received mail about your involvement in an accident weeks ago. Please, are you dead or alive?</DIV>
<DIV>
Mr. Larry made us understand that you are in hospital for treatment but there is no hope of your recovery. He stated that he is your business associates and your next of kin whom you have chosen and permitted to inherit all your properties. He is contacting this office based on your overdue payment fund, which is about to be paid to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
He requested that the payment should now be transferred into his own personal account, as he stated below.</DIV>
<DIV>
Account Name Mr. Larry Wayne Ellis</DIV>
<DIV>
EastWest Bank New York</DIV>
<DIV>
13400 La Cantera Parkway #18</DIV>

San Antonio, New York 77825</DIV>
<DIV>
Routing Number: 132533647</DIV>
<DIV>
Account Number: 5924133211</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Kindly inform us if you are authorizing this process to Mr. Larry Wayne Ellis Bank Account. This is to avoid releasing your money to the wrong person because Mr Larry Wayne Ellis is too eager and ready to follow every instruction to have this money into his account. If you did not have an auto accident and you did not permit Mr. Larry Wayne Ellis to claim your money, kindly reply to this message with your full contact information so we can process the release of your fund to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
