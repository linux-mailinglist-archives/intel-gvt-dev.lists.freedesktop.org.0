<DIV>
Greetings With all due respect,</DIV>
<DIV>
I want you to read my letter with one mind and help me. I am Lana Lea</DIV>
<DIV>
Ruddick , The only daughter of late Mr. and Mrs Ruddick, My Late father was</DIV>
<DIV>
a very wealthy cocoa dealer in Lome Togo before he was poisoned to death by</DIV>
<DIV>
his business associates on one of their outing to discuss on a business</DIV>
<DIV>
deal.</DIV>
<DIV>
my mother died when she was given birth to me,since then my father took me</DIV>
<DIV>
so special because I am motherless. Before the death of my late father (on</DIV>
<DIV>
2nd) June 2021 in a private hospital here in Lome Togo. He secretly called</DIV>
<DIV>
me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of USD5, 000,000.00</DIV>
<DIV>
five million United States dollars left in a suspense account in a local</DIV>
<DIV>
bank here in Lome Togo, that he used my name as his only daughter for the</DIV>
<DIV>
next of kin in deposit of the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was</DIV>
<DIV>
poisoned by his business associates that I should seek for a foreign partner</DIV>
<DIV>
in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for</DIV>
<DIV>
investment purpose, such as real estate agent,</DIV>
<DIV>
I am 17 year old. Dear I am honorably seeking your assistance in the</DIV>
<DIV>
following ways.</DIV>
<DIV>
1) To provide any bank account where this money would be transferred into.</DIV>
<DIV>
2) To serve as the guardian of this fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
3) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my</DIV>
<DIV>
education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.</DIV>
<DIV>
Moreover, I am willing to (offer you 35) percent of the total sum as</DIV>
<DIV>
compensation for your effort input after the successful transfer of this</DIV>
<DIV>
fund to your nominated account overseas.</DIV>
<DIV>
I want you to help me not because of the 35 percent I want to offer you but</DIV>
<DIV>
to take me as your adoptive child and take good care of my life. Please save</DIV>
<DIV>
my life.</DIV>
<DIV>
Hope to hear from you immediately for more details for you to receive the</DIV>
<DIV>
money so that I can be coming to your country immediately after you have</DIV>
<DIV>
receive the money so that I can continue my education while this money will</DIV>
<DIV>
be invested by you.</DIV>
<DIV>
Thanks and God Bless.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp; Best Regards</DIV>
<DIV>
Lana Lea Ruddick.</DIV>
