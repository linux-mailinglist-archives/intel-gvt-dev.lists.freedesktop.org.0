Dear Beloved Friend,

My name is Mrs. Barbara J. Wolniakowski (citizen of Oklahoma, USA), widow
to the late Dr. Jean Wolniakowski, former owner of Petroleum & Gas Company,
based in Kuwait. I am suffering from long time Cancer of the Lungs and
leukemia. From all indications my condition is really deteriorating and
it's quite obvious that I won't live more than 6 months according to my
doctors. This is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I
don't want your pity but I need your trust. My late husband died early last
year from Heart attack, and during the period of our marriage we couldn't
produce any children. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,
I inherited all his businesses and wealth. The doctor has advised me that I
will not live for more than 6 months, so I have now decided to spread all
my wealth, to contribute mainly to the development of research and charity
in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. I am sorry if you are embarrassed by
my mail. I found your e-mail address in the web directory, and I have
decided to contact you, but if for any reason you find this mail offensive,
you can ignore it and please accept my apology.  Before my late husband
died he was major oil tycoon in Kuwait, also deal in Cocoa export from
Africa and had a fund deposit at the bank in the sum of Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$7.5 million) in a fixed deposit some years
ago, that=E2=80=99s all I have left now aside from the cash I have mapped o=
ut here
for my treatment till I pass on.

I need you to collect these funds and distribute it yourself for charity to
help the orphan kids, homeless and retired old people, handicapped persons,
refugees etc. so that when I die my soul can rest in peace. The funds will
be entirely in your hands and management. 20% of this money will be for
your time and effort, while 80% goes to charity. You can get back to me at
your earliest convenience through my email: barbarawolniakowski@hotmail.com

Remain blessed,
Mrs. Barbara Wolniakowski
(United States of America)
