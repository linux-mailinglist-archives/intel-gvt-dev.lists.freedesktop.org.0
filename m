My name is Mr. Mele Kolo Kyari Chief Executive, (Member) with the Nigeria national petroleum corporation (nnpc).

The contract amount was over invoiced to the cost of the contract to US$143,000,000.00. The original contractor (Günther Heigl Daimler AG construction company Germany) has been paid in full amount of his contract fund, what is now left is the top up sum of the U$D143, 000,000.00, (Million United State Dollars) which was over invoiced.

However, we need reliable company / person who will provide us with a foreign account where to transfer and deposit this U$D143, 000,000.00 only investment, that is the reason we are soliciting for your sincere assistance to provide us with an account where to transfer this money as all modalities for the easy transfer of this money is now in place, the period of this transaction is only two weeks from the day we receive your bank account details.

However, when this fund gets to your bank account, we will meet face to face as to sign investment arraignment and sharing. Note that 50% of our share will be invested in your country. We propose to give you 30% of the U$D143, 000,000.00, as my partners and I will get 60% of the money.

The balance of 10% will be allocated to cover all expenses uncured by both partners, and be informed that this proposal is urgent and confidential.

Please send to me your bank account details, full name, address and your private phone and fax number for easy communication, which will also be used in securing the necessary documents for easy transfer of the fund.

Awaiting your urgent response.

Best regards.

Mr. Mele Kolo Kyari Chief Executive, NNPC (Member)
