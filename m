I don’t know how you celebrated the holiday season ... but I imagine<br>
there was food … maybe even too much food. But as we look back with<br>
fondness on our merriment, we need to remember that there is another<br>
side to the season:<br>
<br>
Somewhere in Ukraine, a child is crying for food. A mother has nothing<br>
to offer. A father is ashamed because he can’t provide due to the War<br>
going on there. A grandpa, all alone in the world, has no food to put<br>
on the table.<br>
<br>
Hunger is real. It’s not just a “concept.” Not a mere statistic. It’s<br>
real life. It’s the stress of getting through every single day. It’s the<br>
agonizing question: Where will I find enough to eat?<br>
<br>
My prayer today is that you will help our Netizen Project Teams provide<br>
urgently needed RELIEF for children and adults, families and individuals,<br>
in this war-torn Ukraine. God has blessed us so much. I only ask today<br>
that you share some portion of your God-given blessings ... to express His<br>
love to the poor of Ukraine now.<br>
<br>
• A loving gift of $100 from you today will provide nutritious food other 
reliefs for 10<br>
children and adults.&nbsp;<br>
• Could you give $200, to provide for 20? <br>
• Or $350, to provide for 35? Maybe even more?<br>
<br>

Or <b>Send Gift Card</b> here: <font color="#0000FF">netizens@citromail.hu</font><br>
<br>
By faith, we have already set in motion a full season of outreaches to get<br>
Relief to those who need it most.<br>
<br>
The more you give, the more Relief we’ll be able to share with people in need.<br>
<br>
I hope you’ll be inspired to give generously today. Let’s start 2023 on a joyful<br>
note, knowing that we’re doing all we can to bless Ukraine-- easing suffering,<br>
and offering hope to the Ukrainians.<br>
<br>
Please use this BTC to give now:&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000">3HVhDhVRxa3DQK2YsT8jRMCLaTnnu62N6z</font><br>

I wish you a blessed new year!<br>
<br>
For the Relief to Ukraine,<br>

General Secretary<br>
