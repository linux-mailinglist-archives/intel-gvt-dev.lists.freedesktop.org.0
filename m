Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Daniel Otvos, a European merch=
ant. I am reaching out to you with a heavy heart and a sense of urgency.

Recently, I received devastating news regarding my health. I have been diagno=
sed with late-stage Prostate and Esophageal cancer, leaving me with only a fe=
w months to live, as per medical experts. This unfortunate situation has prom=
pted me to seek a second chance to make a meaningful impact.

Regrettably, my family's greed prevents me from fulfilling my wish to allocat=
e my assets for charitable purposes. Therefore, I am turning to compassionate=
 individuals like yourself for assistance. I am seeking your help to facilita=
te a donation of US$18,600,000.00 to support humanitarian causes in your coun=
try.

Your involvement in this endeavor would mean the world to me and would help m=
e leave a positive legacy despite my health challenges.

Kindly respond to my private email address at daniel.otvos@aol.co.uk at your =
earliest convenience to discuss this matter further.

May you be blessed abundantly for your consideration and kindness.

Warm regards,
Daniel Otvos
