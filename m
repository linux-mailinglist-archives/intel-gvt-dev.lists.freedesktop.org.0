Hello,
I am Mr.Nelson Bile, a lawyer based in Lome, capital city of Togo republic
in West Africa. I need your assistance to claim the sum of $9.8 Million
deposited in a bank by my late client who has the same surname as you. He
died a few years ago. He was an independent oil merchant in my country.

The bank has authorized me as his personal attorney to bring his next of
kin for the fund claim because he died together with the wife and the only
daughter who are supposed to have inherited this fund. He did not indicate
who is to inherit the fund apart from his immediate family that died with
him in an auto crash. So this is why I contacted you. Declare your interest
to enable me to send you the full details.
Regards,
Nelson.
