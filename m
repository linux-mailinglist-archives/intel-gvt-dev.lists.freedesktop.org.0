Attention Dear Honorable Beneficiary.

Please kindly note that your abandoned payment file containing your
payment final transfer approval vital documents has been successfully
retrieved and cleared today by the US Supreme Court, and submitted to
the office of the US President Joe Biden for proper verification,
clarification and authentication.

And after going through your payment file by the US President he has
seen all the charges/fees payment you have made in the past to banks
and institutions in order to receive your fund but all to no avail,
and the President got upset and ordered the US House Finance Services
Committee to deduct all the UNPAID charges holding your fund including
Value Added Tax (VAT) assessment fee once you abstain the Deduction
Clearance Certificate from the US Supreme Court for the final release
of the said fund together with the accrued interest total $49.5M USD
into your bank account without any delay as ordered by the President.

In fact, as I write to you now my dear friend, the US House Finance
Services Committee has concluded all necessary arrangement to deduct
all the charges holding your fund right now, to enable them transfer
the fund into your bank account as ordered by the President. but
before the charges will be deducted, the Deduction Clearance
Certificate must be issued in your name and favor by the US Supreme
Court, which will cost $3,700 only in accordance to the US Supreme
Court order.

This is the only thing needed right now to get the unpaid charges
deducted including VAT assessment fee, which  is calculated to the sum
of $195,000 as contained in your payment file. So you have all
assurance that once this is done your fund will be wired to your
account immediately as ordered by the President.

Note that it is your responsibility as the rightful beneficiary to pay
the $3,700 and obtain this very important Certificate from the US
Supreme Court so that the hindrance charges will be deducted as
ordered by the President. this is all you have to do now if truly you
are ready to receive your fund total $49.5M USD , because without this
nothing can be done.

Please reconfirm the following information =


1. Your full name (first and last name)
2. Your full residential address and your country
3. Nationality
4. Date of birth / sex
5. Occupation
6. Telephone / fax number
7. Your company email address / Personal email address.


Your good understanding is highly appreciated in this regard as I
await your urgent response.

Steve Dickson
Media & Publicity Secretary,
US House Finance Services Committee.
