 style=3D"padding-left: 20%; padding-right: 20%">The reason Home Depot is t=
he first thing that comes to mind is because of its longstanding logo and r=
eputation. Four decades since the company was founded, the Home Depot is sy=
nchronous with home improvement. The association between the two things is =
exactly what Home Depot has always wanted and has helped drive its success.=
<br /> <br /> Just like with any business, creating a logo is an intentiona=
l choice and the intentional choice that Home Depot made back in 1978 hasnt=
 wavered since. With the logo being the staple of the brand for the past 40=
+ years, there are many lessons we can learn from this company.<br /> <br /=
> Read on below to learn more about this iconic brand and how it transforme=
d a simple orange box into one of the most recognizable logos in the world.=
 Meet The Home Depot While you may know Home Depot as your local home impro=
vement store, you likely dont know that the idea of Home Depot was formulat=
ed in a coffee shop in 1978. It was in that Los Angeles coffee shop that Be=
rnie Marcus and Arthur Blank came together with a new store concept. The tw=
o were former high-profiled executives who took their experience being fire=
d from the Handy Dan Home Improvement Center and used this as inspiration f=
or their new concept, Home Depot.<br /> <br /> What the duo came up with wa=
s a one-stop megastore that provided all the products someone would need fo=
r a home project. They wanted the store to offer a wide array of products a=
ll at an affordable price point, and they wanted every store to be filled w=
ith employees that were knowledgeable about the home improvement space. To =
take Home Depot from an idea to a physical retail space, Bernie and Arthur =
brought in Ron Brill, a retail executive, Pat Farrah, a merchandise expert,=
 and Ken Langone, an investment banker.<br /> <br /> Before Home Depot beca=
me Home Depot, the team threw around several other names to call their busi=
ness. After settling on Bad Bernies, an early investor, Marjorie Buckley, g=
ot them to change the name after she disliked it strongly. She suggested th=
e name The Home Depot instead and that name has stuck to this day.<br /> <b=
r /> Today, Home Depot has grown to include 70 distribution centers across =
the United States, and beyond having stores solely in the United States, yo=
u can also find Home Depot in other countries like Canada and Mexico. When =
you walk into a Home Depot, you are walking into Americas largest home impr=
ovement retail store where you can purchase tools, construction items, lumb=
er, services, and more.</p> </td>=20
