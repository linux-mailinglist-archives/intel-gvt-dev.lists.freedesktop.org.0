How many features, across how many attributes is an administrative tool
supposed to check for compatibility?  ie. if we add an 'aggregation'
feature now and 'translucency' feature next year, with new sysfs
attributes and creation options, won't that break this scheme?  I'm not
willing to assume aggregation is the sole new feature we will ever add,
therefore we don't get to make it a special case without a plan for how
the next special case will be integrated.

We also can't even seem to agree that type is a necessary requirement
for compatibility.  Your discussion below of a type-A, which is
equivalent to a type-B w/ aggregation set to some value is an example
of this.  We might also have physical devices with extensions to
support migration.  These could possibly be compatible with full mdev
devices.  We have no idea how an administrative tool would discover
this other than an exhaustive search across every possible target.
That's ugly but feasible when considering a single target host, but
completely untenable when considering a datacenter.

...and then a non_translucency_list and then a non_brilliance_list and
then a non_whatever_list... no.  Additionally it's been shown difficult
to predict the future, if a new device is developed to be compatible
with an existing device it would require updates to the existing device
to learn about that compatibility.

The only potential I see for decoupling the discussions would be to do
aggregation via a vendor attribute.  Those already provide a mechanism
to manipulate a device after creation and something that we'll already
need to solve in determining migration compatibility.  So in that
sense, it seems like it at least doesn't make the problem worse.
Thanks,

Alex
