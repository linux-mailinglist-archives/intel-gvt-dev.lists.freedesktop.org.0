e deposit were given as an expression of appreciation from the various fore=
ign companies whose applications received approval to participate in the in=
-coming Dubai Expo 2020. But I cannot directly receive the gratifications b=
ecause of my sensitive status and various restrictions on my personal life =
as a married Muslin lady. For this reason, an agreement was reached with a =
financial consulting firm to receive the various financial gifts into an op=
en beneficiary account with a financial institution where it will be possib=
le to instruct transfer of right of ownership on the fund to a third party =
for investment purpose which is the reason I am contacting you to receive a=

your indication of interest with capacity to show you can manage the fund. =
Wishing you the best in the year. Reem.
