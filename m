<br /> Internal optical flow with a fixed point and GPS positioning
outside.<br /> When you return home, the power goes out or you receive a
notification that the power has been turned off.<br /> This camera includes
features such as virtual reality mode, multi-lens switching, and
video/picture panorama.<br /> Modes include: MV (one key to return to the
home screen); headless; photo/video gestures; and front lens adjustment.<br
/> GPS/air pressure is a combination of the two in a fixed altitude flight
system.<br /> 30 frames at 3840x2160/4K<br /> Wind resistance is excellent
(wind resistance level of 8)<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Casey Carpenter<br
