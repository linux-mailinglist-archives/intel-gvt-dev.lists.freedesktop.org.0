<p>My beloved good day,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do not be dismayed on how i reac=
hed you because i got your email today in the course of my search for a sin=
cere individual </p><p>who will handle my fund, i decided to reach you beca=
use i know good people still exists and i have prayed to get one who </p><p=
>will accomplish my heart desires,but before i continue, i will like to int=
roduce myself.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>
My name is Rev. Azra Mehmet Ates from Istanbul in Turkey, I am a dying woma=
n who had decided to donate what I have to a </p><p>reliable individual who=
 will act as I will instruct here. I am 68 years old and was diagnosed for =
cancer about 2 years </p><p>ago.I have been touched by God to donate from w=
hat I have inherited from my late father and my career to you for the good =
</p><p>
work of God, rather than allow my uncle to use my fathers hard earned funds=
 ungodly, I really like the poor to be helped.<br><br></p><p>I will be unde=
rgoing an operation in London and my doctors informed me that i may not sur=
vive it due to my excessive </p><p>health deterioration. I want to donate m=
y money to you worth $10,250,000,00usd, it is deposited in a secured bank i=
n </p><p>TURKEY, to you for the good work of the lord, the orphanage, the n=
eedy and to help the motherless.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>
My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than two months =
and I am so scared about it. I have no child of </p><p>mine since my spirit=
ual obligation does not permit me to marry. But through this wonderful Bibl=
e verses, Psalms 119:116 </p><p>&#8230;.Uphold me according unto thy word, =
that I may live, and let me not be ashamed of my hope. Psalms 138: 7 Though=
 I walk in </p><p>
the midst of trouble, thou will revive me. Psalms 41:1 Blessed is he that c=
onsidered the poor, the Lord will deliver him </p><p>in time of trouble. Tw=
o of my favorite verses: Philippians 2:27: For indeed he was sick nigh unto=
 death, but God had mercy </p><p>on him &amp; that on him only, but on me a=
lso, less I should have sorrow upon sorrow.( I always say this in my mind).=
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>
Presently, I have informed my Lawyer and Doctor about my decision in WILLIN=
G this fund to a reliable individual, you are </p><p>to get back to me imme=
diately if you are interested in carrying out this task, so that I will ins=
truct you on how to get </p><p>in contact with my lawyer and my account off=
icer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I know I have never meet you, but in other=
 to fulfill this which borders me most, i prayed and chose you and my </p><=
p>
mind tells me to inform you about this, and I hope you act sincerely, pleas=
e get back to me immediately via my private </p><p>email address (<a href=
=3D"mailto:atetes2020@gmail.com">atetes2020@gmail.com</a>) with the followi=
ng information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>YOUR NAME:</p><p>YOUR E-MAI=
L ADDRESS:</p><p>YOUR COUNTRY:</p><p>YOUR HOME ADDRESS:</p><p>YOUR PHONE NO=
:</p><p>OCCUPATION:</p><p>AGE:&nbsp;</p><p><br>GOD BLESS YOU,</p><p>REV. AZ=
RA MEHMET.</p></body></html>
