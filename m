Hi,<br /> <br /> We are glad to introduce you to the latest innovation, our
20-inch Fat Tire eBike, designed for those who crave both adventure and
practicality. <br /> This eBike embodies a fusion of technology and design,
tailored to elevate your riding experience to unparalleled levels.<br />
<br /> Our new eBike boasts a robust 20" aluminum alloy frame that is both
foldable and durable, ensuring you can take it anywhere with ease. <br />
Its portability does not compromise on performance; equipped with a
suspension front fork, it promises a smooth ride even on the bumpiest
paths. <br /> The heart of our eBike is its powerful 48V 500W rear motor,
paired with a long-lasting 48V 13AH lithium battery, delivering unmatched
speed and range. <br /> This power is seamlessly managed through a Shimano
7 Speed derailleur, offering you control and flexibility over your ride.<br
/> <br /> What sets our eBike apart is its attention to detail and
rider-centric features. The handlebar is fitted with a display throttle and
key meter, <br /> allowing for intuitive control over your eBike's
features. Safety is paramount, which is why we've included mechanical disc
brakes for reliable <br /> stopping power, and the alloy seat tube and
20"x4.0" fat tires ensure comfort and stability on any terrain. Our eBike
doesn't just perform well; <br /> it looks good too, with its sleek black
color, spoke rim, and plastic mud apron keeping you clean and stylish.<br
/> <br /> We are pleased to inform you that our eBikes are currently
well-stocked in our warehouse located in Germany. Shipping to all European
countries <br /> within 3-7 days. If you are interested in making a
purchase, please provide us with the desired quantity and your address.
It's important to note <br /> that costs can vary significantly based on
location, so providing your address will allow us to calculate the exact
price accurately once we receive your request.<br /> <br /><img

theft-resistant. This ensures that your eBike is not only a mode <br /> of
transport but a companion on your adventures, ready to face any challenge
with you.<br /> <br /> Included in each package is everything you need to
get started: the Electric bicycle itself, a charger, and a manual. Weighing
in at just 25kg <br /> and with a compact package size, this eBike is as
convenient as it is powerful.<br /> <br /> We are committed to providing
