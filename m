My Dear Friend,

It is my humble pleasure to solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. My name is: Pierre Bauer, the financial director of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy UK. I am the officer in-charge of offshore remittances to contractors / beneficiaries. We are seeking your assistance to transfer the sum of Forty Seven Million, Eight Hundred Thousand British Pound (GBP 47,800,000.00) to your account for private Investment.

This amount accrued from an Over-invoiced Contract amount for the Construction of an Oil Refinery Sub- station from 2016 to 2019 to expatriate Companies.

The contract was originally valued for One Hundred Million British Pound GBP100, 000,000.00) but we over-invoiced the figure to read GBP 147,800,000.00. Therefore, we have perfected plans to quickly TRANSFER the extra GBP 47,800,000.00 to your Bank Account.

This contract has been completely executed and the original Contractors have been paid all their Contract Bills less this GBP 47,800,000.00 through our partner Banks in UK, United States and Europe.

We shall forward your personal details to the Legal Department of the Bank for the Payment process of the balance GBP 47.8 Million.

Be rest assured that all modalities are set for smooth execution of this viable transaction.

Reply to this E-mail: pierrebauersre@outlook.com

I look forward to your respond to proceed.

Regards,
Pierre Bauer
