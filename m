<p>Hello,<br /> <br /> How is everything going with you?<br /> Have you
received the introduction that we sent you on the little drone-quadcopter
that we sent you last week?<br /> <br /> The drone-quadcopter can fly for
30 minutes nonstop and record video at a frame rate of 25 frames per
second.<br /> Product dimensions: 45x40x12cm (before folding) 21x11x9cm
(after folding)<br /> Dual-mode The positioning system provides GPS
positioning. Brushless motor model number: 1806.<br /> Remote control
range: around 3000m<br /> The remote control's height is roughly 120
meters.<br /> 1-3 meters for gesture recognition shooting Resolution of
aerial images: 4096 x 3072 (APP)<br /> 2048 x 1080 video resolution
(APP)<br /> Frame rate of transmission: 25fps<br /> <br /> The auto return
feature allows you to order the aircraft to take off, land, and even return
to its original spot with the push of a button.<br /> When summoned, the
drone-quadcopter will return to the location from which it took off.<br />
Fixed-point surround: you can now make stunning videos with this
professional drone-quadcopter without doing any extra work.<br /> <br />
The following are the cost details for varied quantities:<br /> 1 unit:
229.90<br /> 2-50 units 209.90 each<br /> 51-100 units 189.90 each<br /><br
/> Would you be interested in purchasing one or two of these?<br /> Send us
your location and we will make the appropriate preparations on your behalf
after contacting the logistics department.<br /><br /><img

width="585" height="812" /><br /> <br /> The development of optical flow
occurs from the combination of a fixed point located within the system and
a GPS position retrieved from outside the system.<br /> When you walk
through your front door, either the electricity is totally turned off or
you receive a notification stating that the energy has been turned off.<br
/> This camera also has a virtual reality mode, as well as the option to
switch between various lenses, a video/picture panorama, and a
video/picture panorama.<br /> There are also MV (with a single button to
return to the home screen), headless, photo/video gestures, and front lens
adjustment modes. Each of these modes has its own set of capabilities.<br
/> The GPS and air pressure combination employed in the system for flying
at a fixed altitude is essentially a hybrid of the two technologies.<br />
Wind resistance is rated as an 8, and it is measured in meters per
second.<br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Jonathan Durham<br /> <br /> <br
