 Attention: Beneficiary,

This is to congratulate you and officially inform you that your over due
payment of $37million USD has been approved to you via (T/T) Transfer,
conformable in 3 working days.

This payment was personally approved by the Presidency because of the
fraudulent practices going on in our Apex Bank and most of our Global
Payment Centers which have failed to carry out their duties effectively.

You are required to reconfirm your full details and account details for
onward transfer of your funds, because we will not be held responsible for
wrong crediting.

Upon the receipt of your account details, we will give you the fund
ownership certificate and the approved certificate which will prove that
you are the rightful beneficiary of the funds, it will also clear you from
tax payment on your contract fund upon receipt.

Treat as urgent.

For any question, feel free to call me on my direct line: +234 901 563 0103.

Thanks,

Yours faithfully,
Mr. David Ojo.
(Director, Foreign Operation)
Presidential Finance House
