ever, it's just my urgent need for a foreign partner that made me contact y=
ou for this transaction, My name is Mr. Williams Park, I am a banker by pro=
fession and I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both =
of us, as an officer in my Bank; it is my duty to send in a financial repor=
t to my Head Office at the end of each business year.

On the course of last fourteen years 2010 business report, I discovered tha=
t my branch in which I am rank officer made Ten Million Five hundred Thousa=
nd United State Dollars ($10,500.000.00) which my Head Office are not aware=
 of and will never be aware of it. I have placed this fund on suspense acco=
unt with no beneficiary. As an officer of this bank i cannot be directly co=
nnected to this money, this informed my contacting you. Indeed I will appre=
ciate if you can receive this money in your bank account and get 30% of the=
 total funds. There are practically no risks involved, it is simple bank to=
 bank transfer, all I need from you is to stand claim as one of our custome=
r who has been banking with us and the depositor of this funds with my bran=
ch, so that upon your request for its immediate transfer my head Office wil=
l not hesitate to transfer to your designated bank account.

I will give you more details once I hear from you declaring your interest t=
o cooperate with me.


Yours Sincerely,

Mr. Williams Park
