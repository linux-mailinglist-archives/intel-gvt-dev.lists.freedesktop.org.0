Hello Dear,</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
My name is Douglas O'Connor. I am an American soldier, presently in Iraq for the training, advising the Iraqi forces and also helping in stabilizing the country against security challenges. With a very desperate need for assistance, I have decided to contact you for your kind assistance to move the sum of (US$38,000,000.00) Thirty eight Million United States Dollars to you for investment purposes if I can be assured that my share will be safe in your care until I complete my service.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Some money in various currencies was discovered in boxes at a farmhouse during a rescue operation we conducted in one of the attacks by the terrorists and it was agreed by my colleagues and I that some part of this money be shared among us. The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a British doctor working with Red Cross, I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of trouble spot. he does not know the real content of the package, and believes that it belongs to a British /American medical doctor who died in a raid here in Afghanistan, and before giving up, trusted me to hand over the package to his Family.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I have now found a much secured way of getting the package out of Iraq to you for pick up and I will discuss this with you when I am sure that you are willing to assist me. I am ready to compensate you with 30% of the $38 million USD for your assistance.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I do not know how long we will remain here, and I have been shot, wounded and survived two suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
