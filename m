How has your day been going?
I want to share a message that has been spre=
ading all over the
internet that concerns the times we are living in. Whe=
ther you believe
in God or not, this is a must read message!
We can see=
 throughout time how we have been slowly conditioned to come
to this poin=
t where we are on the verge of a cashless society. Would
it surprise you =
to know that the Bible foretold of this event? Don't
believe me? This may=
 be the most imporant message you will read in
these times...please do no=
t ignore this!
This messsage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and t=
he meaning
behind counting a number people have been pondering for centur=
ies,
666. This message also shares why Barack Obama is the Antichrist as=

well as the gospel message. This is truly a message from God!
In the R=
evelation of Jesus Christ given to the apostle John, we read:
.."And he (=
the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles)
causeth all, both sm=
all and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to
receive a mark in their r=
ight hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save=
 he that had the mark, or the
name of the beast, or the number of his nam=
e.
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
=
the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six
hundred t=
hreescore and six" (Revelation 13:16-18 BRG)...
Referring to the last gen=
eration, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelati=
on 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark o=
f the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell wit=
h one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture=
. So, it deduces itself to
this conclusion.
These verses could not be r=
eferring to something spiritual as
scripture references two physical loca=
tions (our right-hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on one "OR" t=
he other. It once
again deduces itself to this conclusion.
Also, how co=
uld you determine who truly has a spiritual mark so that
they may buy or =
sell? And, as you will read further in this message,
to have the mark of =
the beast is the same to have the name of the
beast, and the number of it=
s name. You will begin to see even more
clearly why this mark cannot be s=
omething purely spiritual.
Here is where it really starts to come togethe=
r. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is concerning the RFID microchip=
. These are notes
from a man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of=
 engineers to
help develop this microchip in the late 1960's.
Carl Sand=
ers attended seventeen New World Order conferences with heads
of state of=
ficials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the C.I.A.
to discuss pl=
ans on how to bring forth this one-world system. The
government commissio=
ned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling th=
e peoples of the world-a microchip that
could be placed under the skin wi=
th a hypodermic needle (a quick,
convenient method that would be progress=
ively accepted by the world).
Carl Sanders, with a crew of engineers with=
 him, with U.S. grant
monies provided by US tax dollars, took on this ass=
ignment and
produced a RFID chip that's powered by a lithium battery, rec=
hargeable
via the temperature fluctuations in our skin. Without having kn=
owledge
of the Bible (Mr. Sanders was not a follower of Christ at the tim=
e),
these men spent one-and-a-half-million dollars gathering information=

on the best and most convenient location to have the RFID chip placed
=
within the body.
Guess what? These researchers determined that the forehe=
ad and the
back of the hand (the two places Revelation says the mark will=
 be
received) aren't only the most convenient spots, however are
additi=
onally the only viable places for constant, steady temperature
fluctuatio=
ns inside the skin to recharge the lithium battery. The RFID
chip is appr=
oximately seven millimeters in length, .75 millimeters in
diameter, about=
 the dimensions of a grain of rice. It is capable of
holding pages of det=
ails about you. All your basic information, work
data, crime records, hea=
lth records, and financial records could be
stored on this microchip.
C=
arl Sanders believes that this RFID chip, which he regretfully helped
bri=
ng forth, is the "mark" spoken about in Revelation 13:16-18. The
original=
 Greek word for "mark" is "charagma," which is defined as a
"scratch or e=
tching." Additionally it is fascinating to note that the
number 666 is ac=
tually a word in the original Greek language. That
word is "chi xi stigma=
," with the last word, "stigma," additionally
meaning "to stick or prick.=
 Carl believes that is alluding to using a
hypodermic needle being poked =
into a person to insert the RFID chip."
Carl Sanders asked a Boston Medic=
al Center doctor what would happen if
the lithium contained within the RF=
ID microchip leaked into the body.
The doctor responded that if the micro=
chip broke inside a human body,
the lithium would cause a severe and pain=
ful wound filled with pus.
This is what the scriptures of Revelation 16:2=
 says:
"And the first (angel) went and poured out his bowl into the land=
=E2=80=94
and a bad and evil sore came upon the people having the mark of=
 the
beast and the ones giving worship to his image" (Revelation 16:2
D=
LNT).
THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!
What I first w=
ant to mention, before I share what the Holy Spirit has
revealed to me co=
ncerning the number of the beast, is that God
confirms in threes. We can =
see this throughout scripture:
"For there are three that bear witness in =
heaven: the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are on=
e" (1 John 5:7 NKJV).
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the=
 third day
according to the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).
"...=
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to
come!" (Rev=
elation 4:8 NKJV).
There are many more examples, but I thought I would ju=
st share three
of them to make the point.
Examining Revelation 13:16,17=
,18, the first group of three I would
like to point out is that the mark =
of the beast is described in three
separate verses, 16, 17 and 18.
The =
next three I see is in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed by
three =
contrasting categories of people,
1 - "both small and great,
2 - rich a=
nd poor,
3 - free and slave...".
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "an=
d that no one may buy or sell
except one who has...", followed by three e=
xplanations of what one
must have to buy or sell,
1 - "...the mark
2 =
- or the name of the beast,
3 - or the number of his name".
Now unto ve=
rse 18, we read "Let him who has understanding
calculate...", which is fo=
llowed by,=C2=A0
1 - "the number of the beast,
2 - for it is the number=
 of a man:
3 - His number is 666".
The last three I see is the number "=
6" being used three times in a
row. The reason I'm making this point abou=
t God confirming in three is
because it is the key to unlocking how to ca=
lculate the number 666.
Throughout the centuries there have been people t=
rying to calculate
numbers based on titles and names that come up to the =
number 666 to
identify one person, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13=
:18, I do
not see where God is telling us to count up to 666, but rather =
to
count the number of the beast. This number is identified as 666. So
=
the verse is telling us to count the number 666.
What does it mean to cou=
nt? It means to add up. So how could we add up
666? Remember my previous =
point about God confirming in threes is key
to unlocking the number 666. =
So logically, what would be the best way
to count the number 666? To coun=
t it equally by using the rule of
three based off the number.
We cannot=
 count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back
to the start=
.
We cannot count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no
z=
eroes in between or at the end of 666.
The only logical option is 6+6+6=
=3D18.
What is interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count=
 the
number itself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in Revelation=

Chapter 13), being the third verse out of the three verses that
descri=
be the mark of the beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is 18
divided by=
 3? 6. So 3x6=3D18, or 6+6+6=3D18.
Another interesting point is the only =
two other combinations (making a
total of three possible combinations) fo=
r placing a "+" symbol in
between 666 are:
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=
=3D72.
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.
Why the number=
 144 is worth our attention is because the verse
following Revelation 13:=
18 is the first time in the Bible where the
144,000 are being described i=
n detail:
"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and =
with
Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=
=99s name
written on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).
Now if you =
add up all three numbers from counting 666 by moving the
"+" symbol aroun=
d, it would be 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about
the number 162, i=
s, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The
name of Jesus in Greek =
gematria adds up to 888. The New Testament was
originally written in the =
Greek language. Revelation 14:1 not only
mentions the 144,000, but also t=
he Lamb who is Jesus.
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus,=
 888, is that if
you apply the same formula that was used to count 666, y=
ou get
8+8+8=3D24. Why the number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there=
 are
24 elders seated around the throne of God. This is the same throne=

where Jesus sits.
Now if you take:
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24
=E2=80=
=A2 8+88=3D96
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96
you get 24+96+96=3D216.
Take 144,00=
0 divided by 216 and you get 666.
Remember that this was the same exact f=
ormula we used to count the
number 666 that ultimately brought forth the =
number 888.
Here is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirm=
s itself
as being the true way to count 666:
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=
=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D=
888
3: 8+8+8=3D24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216=

4: 144,000 divided by 216=3D666
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...
As=
 you can see, it is perpetual. And remember that we consistently
used a f=
ormula that worked in threes being the number that God uses
for confirmat=
ion.
By using the identical method of counting by including the "+" symbo=
l
in between the numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a
man=
ner?
The book of Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various=

forms. For instance 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is
interest=
ing about the number 37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any
number tha=
t contains the same single digit three times in a row, such
as 111 to 999=
, it comes out to the value of if you were to add all
three numbers up. F=
or example 888 divided by 37 equals 24. So
8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by =
37 equals 18. So 6+6+6=3D18. Could this be
another way of God's word conf=
irming itself that the mystery behind
calculating the number 666 indeed i=
s 18?
Another fascinating factor to note is that if you add up all the
=
numbers from 1 to 36 (1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as
in t=
hree sixes? May this be a hint that we should add up three sixes
instead =
of perceiving the number as six-hundred sixty six?
So what may this sugge=
st? We all know in this world we are recognized
by numbers in numerous fo=
rms. From our birth certificates to our
social security card, as well as =
our drivers license, being recognized
based on a system of ruler ship. So=
 it's conceivable that this RFID
chip will contain a brand new identifica=
tion that has a complete total
of 18 characters.
"here the wisdom is, t=
he one having the mind let him calculate the
number of the wild beast, nu=
mber for "of human" it is, and the number
of it 666" (Revelation 13:1, Gr=
eek Translation).
The Greek word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 =
where it says "of
human" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first=
 two
definitions of the word are "a human being, whether male or female",=

and, "generically, to include all human individuals". Could the number=

of the beast apply to all mankind?
In the Greek (the New Testament was=
 originally written in the Greek
language), and other translations, you w=
ill notice the beast is
described as an "it", instead of "him". The reaso=
n I'm making this
point is because when a translation says "His number is=
 666", this
would imply a singular person, the Antichrist. But by saying =
"the
number of it 666", implies that it is of the beast system as a whole=
.
We can know the number of the beast cannot be to identify products
(l=
ike a new barcode) to buy or sell because scripture says we cannot
buy or=
 sell without the number of the beast. What am I getting at?
There will b=
e instances where you could buy something someone made
themselves and it =
wouldn't have a store branded identification on it.
But for this number t=
o be in our chips, that is where it must be to
conclude ultimately that w=
e cannot buy or sell without having the
number of the beast. As previousl=
y mentioned in Revelation 13:18, the
number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is =
a "human number", definition
"generically, to include all human individua=
ls".
May this be the title of the beast, the number of its name? The
on=
e-world beast system which is recognized by 18 characters? This
might mat=
ch the scriptures that speaks of a mark that we ought to have
to buy or s=
ell in our right-hand or forehead, and that it additionally
consists of t=
he number of the beast, throughout a future cashless
money society.
Her=
e is another mathematical confirmation: 144,000 divided by 6,
divided by =
6, divided by 6 (6,6,6) equals 666. To see many more of
these amazing cal=
culations, read the article about the RFID Mark of
the Beast and the numb=
er 666...
Do we believe blind forces gave us eyes to see? That deaf force=
s gave
us ears to hear? That careless forces gave us a heart to care for=

others? That faithless forces uphold the universe and all the laws
tha=
t govern it and that is why we should trust them? That mindless
forces ga=
ve us a mind to think and comprehend these things? If there
is a God, He =
must be personal, because we as His creation are personal
beings. How do =
we get to personally know anybody? By their word...The
words of Jesus hav=
e been translated into over 2,000 languages, and
nothing comes remotely c=
lose (the Quran about 110). If that is not
God's word, nothing is. Why? W=
hy would a personal loving God who
desires for us to know Him, who is all=
 powerful, allow man to create a
word far surperior than His to be spread=
 around the world throughout
time in so many different languages to decei=
ve the world so we may not
know the truth about Him?
God has shown me s=
ome time ago that Trump will have a second term (he
will be back soon!), =
and that this will be the time where the two
witnesses of Revelation 11 w=
ill rise up (who are the 144,000) to
prophesy for 42 months to every trib=
e, tongue, nation and people
before the beast rises from the sea in Revel=
ation 13. We will see His
Holy Spirit move across the world in a mighty w=
ay bringing a great
multitude to God. God gave me a vision that Obama wil=
l be back in
2024.

believes this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:6
Someone said =
we are being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is
taking place be=
tween good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literally
(riots, unres=
t, politics). If you take the current year 2020 and
divide it by the numb=
er 666 (known for its satanic implications) you
will get the number 30330=
 (repeated). This number 30330 happens to be
the number used to vote for =
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Freaky?
Supernatural? Odd for sure. Whatever=
 this means, it doesn=E2=80=99t seem
good to me. First, why would anyone =
knowingly choose those particular
numbers for their campaign? If they wer=
en=E2=80=99t knowingly chosen, then
it appears to be a supernatural act b=
y the evil one himself and I
would want to change those numbers ASAP. And=
 if the numbers were
chosen knowing their significance, are you satanic? =
Is this campaign
satanic? Either way I do not believe this is a coinciden=
ce. And one
thing is certain, 2020 is truly being divided by Satan. He is=
 the
master deceiver and spreader of chaos. Jesus calls him the father of=

lies."
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, and I fo=
und
this information:=C2=A0
If you send a text to that number (at that =
time), you would get a
response asking to support Joe's campaign to take =
down Donald Trump,
with one part in caps saying "CHIP IN >>" pointing to =
a link to go and
donate.
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase in the p=
ast on his twitter and
people believe it is a subliminal message to recei=
ve the mark of the
beast, that is to say the implantable RFID microCHIP t=
hat will go IN
our body.
God's word warns us in the last days that a fa=
lse prophet will stand
up performing miracles to deceive many to obtain t=
he beasts mark:
.."But the beast was captured, and with it the false prop=
het who had
performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had de=
luded
those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its imag=
e.
The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning
sul=
fur" (Revelation 19:20 NIV)..
At ALL COSTS, resist the mark!
"Then a th=
ird angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If
anyone worships th=
e beast and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his ha=
nd, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is=
 poured out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be to=
rmented with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in=
 the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever=
 and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and =
his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11=
).
We're living in very prophetic times with major Biblical prophecies
=
coming to pass.
When Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as capital of Isra=
el on
December 6 2017, this was a large step to bring about the Third Tem=
ple
prophesied in the Holy Bible.
God's Holy scriptures warns us that t=
he Antichrist will seat himself
in this temple:
"...and the man of sin =
is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes
and exalts himself above a=
ll that is called God or that is worshiped,
so that he sits as God in the=
 temple of God, showing himself that he
is God" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).=

In the Islamic religion, there is a man known as the Mahdi, referred
t=
o as their messiah who they're awaiting to be revealed. There are
various=
 testimonies from people on line who consider this man will be
Barack Oba=
ma who may be the biblical Antichrist. I personally have had
unusual drea=
ms (you can read them in my article on the website above)
about Barack Ob=
ama. He came on stage proclaiming himself to be a
Christian with no affil=
iation to the Muslim faith, however it was
later revealed by his circle o=
f relatives that he indeed is a
religious Muslim.
So what's in the name=
? The meaning of someones name can say a lot
about a person. God througho=
ut history has given names to people that
have a specific meaning tied to=
 their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what=
 may be hiding beneath the surface...
Jesus says, "And He said to them, '=
I saw Satan fall like lightning
from heaven'" (Luke 10:18).
In Hebrew, =
the word "Barack" means "lighting", and the usage of "Bama"
(Strongs Hebr=
ew phrase 1116) is used to mean the "heights" of heaven.
=C2=A0
The fol=
lowing day after the election of Barack Obama (11/04/08), the
winning cho=
ose three lotto numbers in Illinois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic
state) for =
11/5/08 were 666.
Obama had been U.S. senator for the state of Illinois, =
and his zip
code was 60606.
The names of both of Obama's daughters are =
Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backwards we would get=
 "ailam ahsatan". Now
if we remove the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah b=
eing the God of
Islam), we get "I am Satan". Coincidence? I don't think s=
o.
These are just a few of many evidences why Barack Obama is the
Antic=
hrist. You can see many more in my article on the website above,
as well =
as read about the dreams I've had concerning this man. I'm
more than conv=
inced that God has shown me that he is without a doubt
the Antichrist, an=
d we will see him rise to power in the not so
dinstant future.
So, why =
do we need Jesus?
"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God=
" (Romans
2:23).
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is=
 eternal life in
Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
Our good works c=
an't save our souls from the wrong we've committed. If
we step before a j=
udge in the court of law, being responsible of a
crime, the judge is not =
going to judge us by the good that we've
carried out, but rather the crim=
es we've committed. If we as fallen
humanity, created in God's image, pos=
e this type of justice, how much
more a perfect, righteous, and Holy God?=

God has introduced to us His ethical regulation's through the 10
comma=
ndments given to Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guidelines were
not give=
n so we may be justified, but in order that we could see the
need for a s=
aviour. They are the mirror of God's character of what He
has put in each=
 of us, with our conscious bearing witness that we know
that it's an act =
of evil to steal, lie, dishonor our parents, and so
forth.
We can striv=
e to observe all the ethical laws of the 10 commandments,
but we'll in no=
 way catch up to them to be justified before a Holy
God. That same word o=
f the law given to Moses became flesh over 2000
years ago inside the body=
 of Jesus Christ. He came to be our
justification by perfectly fulfilling=
 the commandments of God, living
a sinless life that only God may accompl=
ish.
The space between us and the law can in no way be reconciled by our=

own merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and
merc=
y of God. And if we are to seize hold of, through faith in Him,
He'll pul=
l us up being the one to justify us. As inside the court of
law, if someb=
ody steps in and pays your debt, despite the fact that
you're guilty, the=
 judge can do what is legal and just and allow you
to go free. That is wh=
at Jesus did almost 2000 years in the past on
the cross. It was a legal t=
ransaction being fulfilled inside the
spiritual realm by the shedding of =
His blood, with His last words
being, "...It is finished!..." (John 19:30=
).
Now why did Jesus have to die for us?
Because God is Holy and just, =
the wrath that we deserve could not be
brushed away. Through the perfect =
righteousness and justice of God's
character, it ought to be reconciled, =
it ought to be quenched and
satisfied.
For God takes no pleasure in the=
 death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
That is why in Isaiah chapter 53, w=
here it speaks of the coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for o=
ur sins, why it says it
satisfied God to crush His only begotten Son.
T=
hat is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being
poured ou=
t upon His Son. For if it was poured out on us who've earned
it, we would=
 all die and go to hell. God created a way of escape by
pouring it out on=
 His Son who's soul could not stay in Hades, but was
raised and seated on=
 the right hand of God in power.
Now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ=
 (Romans 13:14), God no longer
see's the individual who deserves His wrat=
h, but rather the glorious
image of His perfect Son residing in our heart=
s, justifying us as if
we obtained the wrath we deserve, making a way of =
escape from the
curse of death.
Now what we ought to do is turn from ou=
r sins and believe in the
saviour, confessing and forsaking our sins. Tha=
t is not just a head
knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receivin=
g His words,
taking them to heart. Where we no longer live to practice si=
n, but
turn from our sins and practice righteousness:
"Do you not know =
that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of
God? Do not be decei=
ved. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor homosexuals,=
 nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous,
nor drunkards, nor revilers, n=
or extortioners will inherit the kingdom
of God. And such were some of yo=
u. But you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you were justified i=
n the name of the Lord Jesus and
by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corinthians=
 6:9-11).
By doing so we will become transformed into the image of God th=
rough
faith in His Son Christ Jesus Who is willing to provide the Holy
=
Spirit to those that ask of Him:
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, u=
nless one is born of water and
the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of=
 God. That which is born of
the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of=
 the Spirit is spirit. Do
not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be bor=
n again.' (John 3:5-6).
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, =
if indeed the Spirit
of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have th=
e Spirit of
Christ, he is not His" (Romans 8:9).
Now what are you waiti=
ng for? Our heavenly Father only desires the
best for us, restoring every=
thing this world has stolen from us. That
is what it means to be "holy". =
To be made whole.
He's waiting to hear from you. That God given tongue to=
 speak
language, by using faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgive you by=

confessing your sins and be willing to forsake them; that you receive
=
the sacrifice of His Son Jesus on the cross, and that you want His
Holy S=
pirit living inside you reworking you into a child of God.
Jesus says, "b=
ut whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him
(the Holy Spirit) wi=
ll never thirst. But the water that I shall give
him will become in him a=
 fountain of water springing up into
everlasting life."
Did you know th=
at Jesus spoke more about hell than anybody in the word
of God, even more=
 than He spoke about heaven?! For this very purpose
He came to die for us=
, to rescue us from this place that we earned by
our sins against a holy =
God.
=C2=A0
He describes hell as a real place where,
"Their worm does=
 not die
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44).
And where,
"There=
 will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13:28).
Jesus tells us w=
ho to fear,
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the =
soul. But
rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in he=
ll"
(Matthew 10:28).
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the f=
irst heaven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more s=
ea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of he=
aven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a=
 loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with me=
n, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself=
 will
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear fr=
om
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
Th=
ere shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'
Then =
He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He sa=
id to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'
And He said to =
me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End.=
 I will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirs=
ts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and =
he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers,=
 sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their p=
art in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second =
death.'"
(Revelation 21:1-8).

<body>How has your day been going?<br />
<br />
I want to share a message that has been spreading all over the internet tha=
t concerns the times we are living in. Whether you believe in God or not, t=
his is a must read message!<br />
<br />
We can see throughout time how we have been slowly conditioned to come to t=
his point where we are on the verge of a cashless society. Would it surpris=
e you to know that the Bible foretold of this event? Don't believe me? This=
 may be the most imporant message you will read in these times...please do =
not ignore this!<br />
<br />
This messsage reveals what the Mark of the Beast is, and the meaning behind=
 counting a number people have been pondering for centuries, 666. This mess=
age also shares why Barack Obama is the Antichrist as well as the gospel me=
ssage. This is truly a message from God!<br />
<br />
In the Revelation of Jesus Christ given to the apostle John, we read:<br />
<br />
.."And he (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles) causeth all=
, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in =
their right hand, or in their foreheads:<br />
<br />
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name o=
f the beast, or the number of his name.<br />
<br />
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the bea=
st: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore=
 and six" (Revelation 13:16-18 BRG)...<br />
<br />
Referring to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a cashless=
 society. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or sell unless =
we receive the mark of the beast. If physical money was still in use, we co=
uld buy or sell with one another without receiving the mark. This would con=
tradict scripture. So, it deduces itself to this conclusion.<br />
<br />
These verses could not be referring to something spiritual as scripture ref=
erences two physical locations (our right-hand or forehead) stating the mar=
k will be on one "OR" the other. It once again deduces itself to this concl=
usion.<br />
<br />
Also, how could you determine who truly has a spiritual mark so that they m=
ay buy or sell? And, as you will read further in this message, to have the =
mark of the beast is the same to have the name of the beast, and the number=
 of its name. You will begin to see even more clearly why this mark cannot =
be something purely spiritual.<br />
<br />
Here is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how accurat=
e the Bible is concerning the RFID microchip. These are notes from a man na=
med Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help develop this m=
icrochip in the late 1960's.<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders attended seventeen New World Order conferences with heads of s=
tate officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the C.I.A. to discu=
ss plans on how to bring forth this one-world system. The government commis=
sioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for identifying and controlling t=
he peoples of the world-a microchip that could be placed under the skin wit=
h a hypodermic needle (a quick, convenient method that would be progressive=
ly accepted by the world).<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders, with a crew of engineers with him, with U.S. grant monies pro=
vided by US tax dollars, took on this assignment and produced a RFID chip t=
hat's powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable via the temperature fluctu=
ations in our skin. Without having knowledge of the Bible (Mr. Sanders was =
not a follower of Christ at the time), these men spent one-and-a-half-milli=
on dollars gathering information on the best and most convenient location t=
o have the RFID chip placed within the body.<br />
<br />
Guess what? These researchers determined that the forehead and the back of =
the hand (the two places Revelation says the mark will be received) aren't =
only the most convenient spots, however are additionally the only viable pl=
aces for constant, steady temperature fluctuations inside the skin to recha=
rge the lithium battery. The RFID chip is approximately seven millimeters i=
n length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the dimensions of a grain of r=
ice. It is capable of holding pages of details about you. All your basic in=
formation, work data, crime records, health records, and financial records =
could be stored on this microchip.<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders believes that this RFID chip, which he regretfully helped brin=
g forth, is the "mark" spoken about in Revelation 13:16-18. The original Gr=
eek word for "mark" is "charagma," which is defined as a "scratch or etchin=
g." Additionally it is fascinating to note that the number 666 is actually =
a word in the original Greek language. That word is "chi xi stigma," with t=
he last word, "stigma," additionally meaning "to stick or prick. Carl belie=
ves that is alluding to using a hypodermic needle being poked into a person=
 to insert the RFID chip."<br />
<br />
Carl Sanders asked a Boston Medical Center doctor what would happen if the =
lithium contained within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The docto=
r responded that if the microchip broke inside a human body, the lithium wo=
uld cause a severe and painful wound filled with pus. This is what the scri=
ptures of Revelation 16:2 says:<br />
<br />
"And the first (angel) went and poured out his bowl into the land=E2=80=
=94 and a bad and evil sore came upon the people having the mark of the bea=
st and the ones giving worship to his image" (Revelation 16:2 DLNT).<br />
<br />
THE HIDDEN MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBER 666 REVEALED!<br />
<br />
What I first want to mention, before I share what the Holy Spirit has revea=
led to me concerning the number of the beast, is that God confirms in three=
s. We can see this throughout scripture:<br />
<br />
"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and=
 the Holy Spirit; and these three are one" (1 John 5:7 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to =
the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4 NKJV).<br />
<br />
"...Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" (R=
evelation 4:8 NKJV).<br />
<br />
There are many more examples, but I thought I would just share three of the=
m to make the point.<br />
<br />
Examining Revelation 13:16,17,18, the first group of three I would like to =
point out is that the mark of the beast is described in three separate vers=
es, 16, 17 and 18.<br />
<br />
The next three I see is in verse 16, "He causes all..." is followed by thre=
e contrasting categories of people,<br />
<br />
1 - "both small and great,<br />
2 - rich and poor,<br />
3 - free and slave...".<br />
<br />
Then unto verse 17, it opens with, "and that no one may buy or sell except =
one who has...", followed by three explanations of what one must have to bu=
y or sell,<br />
<br />
1 - "...the mark<br />
2 - or the name of the beast,<br />
3 - or the number of his name".<br />
<br />
Now unto verse 18, we read "Let him who has understanding calculate...", wh=
ich is followed by,=C2=A0<br />
<br />
1 - "the number of the beast,<br />
2 - for it is the number of a man:<br />
3 - His number is 666".<br />
<br />
The last three I see is the number "6" being used three times in a row. The=
 reason I'm making this point about God confirming in three is because it i=
s the key to unlocking how to calculate the number 666.<br />
<br />
Throughout the centuries there have been people trying to calculate numbers=
 based on titles and names that come up to the number 666 to identify one p=
erson, the Antichrist; but from Revelation 13:18, I do not see where God is=
 telling us to count up to 666, but rather to count the number of the beast=
. This number is identified as 666. So the verse is telling us to count the=
 number 666.<br />
<br />
What does it mean to count? It means to add up. So how could we add up 666?=
 Remember my previous point about God confirming in threes is key to unlock=
ing the number 666. So logically, what would be the best way to count the n=
umber 666? To count it equally by using the rule of three based off the num=
ber.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it equally as 600+60+6, this would also bring us back to th=
e start.<br />
<br />
We cannot count it as 600+600+600, or 60+60+60 because there are no zeroes =
in between or at the end of 666.<br />
<br />
The only logical option is 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
What is interesting is that the verse that reveals for us to count the numb=
er itself is verse 18 (there a total of 18 verses in Revelation Chapter 13)=
, being the third verse out of the three verses that describe the mark of t=
he beast in Revelation 13:16,17,18. What is 18 divided by 3? 6. So 3x6=3D18=
, or 6+6+6=3D18.<br />
<br />
Another interesting point is the only two other combinations (making a tota=
l of three possible combinations) for placing a "+" symbol in between 666 a=
re:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 66+6=3D72 and 6+66=3D72.<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 Add both 72's together and you get 144.<br />
<br />
Why the number 144 is worth our attention is because the verse following Re=
velation 13:18 is the first time in the Bible where the 144,000 are being d=
escribed in detail:<br />
<br />
"Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one=
 hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father=E2=80=99s name written =
on their foreheads..." (Revelation 14:1).<br />
<br />
Now if you add up all three numbers from counting 666 by moving the "+" sym=
bol around, it would be 72+72+18=3D162. What is compelling about the number=
 162, is, if you divide 144,000 by 162, you get 888. The name of Jesus in G=
reek gematria adds up to 888. The New Testament was originally written in t=
he Greek language. Revelation 14:1 not only mentions the 144,000, but also =
the Lamb who is Jesus.<br />
<br />
Now what is interesting about the number for Jesus, 888, is that if you app=
ly the same formula that was used to count 666, you get 8+8+8=3D24. Why the=
 number 24? Revelation chapter 4 tells us there are 24 elders seated around=
 the throne of God. This is the same throne where Jesus sits.<br />
<br />
Now if you take:<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+8+8=3D24<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 8+88=3D96<br />
<br />
=E2=80=A2 88+8=3D96<br />
<br />
you get 24+96+96=3D216.<br />
<br />
Take 144,000 divided by 216 and you get 666.<br />
<br />
Remember that this was the same exact formula we used to count the number 6=
66 that ultimately brought forth the number 888.<br />
<br />
Here is a quick recap to demonstrate how this formula confirms itself as be=
ing the true way to count 666:<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72 =C2=BB 6+66=3D72 =C2=BB 18+72+72=3D162<br />
<br />
2: 144,000 divided by 162=3D888<br />
<br />
3: 8+8+8=3D24 =C2=BB 88+8=3D96 =C2=BB 8+88=3D96 =C2=BB 24+96+96=3D216<br />
<br />
4: 144,000 divided by 216=3D666<br />
<br />
1: 6+6+6=3D18 =C2=BB 66+6=3D72...<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is perpetual. And remember that we consistently used a f=
ormula that worked in threes being the number that God uses for confirmatio=
n.<br />
<br />
By using the identical method of counting by including the "+" symbol in be=
tween the numbers, why do all these numbers relate in such a manner?<br />
<br />
The book of Revelation contains the use of the number 7 in various forms. F=
or instance 7 seals, 7 trumpets, and 7 bowls. What is interesting about the=
 number 37 (three sevens) is if if you divide any number that contains the =
same single digit three times in a row, such as 111 to 999, it comes out to=
 the value of if you were to add all three numbers up. For example 888 divi=
ded by 37 equals 24. So 8+8+8=3D24. Or 666 divided by 37 equals 18. So 6+6+=
6=3D18. Could this be another way of God's word confirming itself that the =
mystery behind calculating the number 666 indeed is 18?<br />
<br />
Another fascinating factor to note is that if you add up all the numbers fr=
om 1 to 36 (1+2+3...+36), it totals 666. The number 36, as in three sixes? =
May this be a hint that we should add up three sixes instead of perceiving =
the number as six-hundred sixty six?<br />
<br />
So what may this suggest? We all know in this world we are recognized by nu=
mbers in numerous forms. From our birth certificates to our social security=
 card, as well as our drivers license, being recognized based on a system o=
f ruler ship. So it's conceivable that this RFID chip will contain a brand =
new identification that has a complete total of 18 characters.<br />
<br />
"here the wisdom is, the one having the mind let him calculate the number o=
f the wild beast, number for "of human" it is, and the number of it 666" (R=
evelation 13:1, Greek Translation).<br />
<br />
The Greek word "anthr=C5=8Dpos" being used in verse 18 where it says "of hu=
man" is the Greek strongs concordance G444. The first two definitions of th=
e word are "a human being, whether male or female", and, "generically, to i=
nclude all human individuals". Could the number of the beast apply to all m=
ankind?<br />
<br />
In the Greek (the New Testament was originally written in the Greek languag=
e), and other translations, you will notice the beast is described as an "i=
t", instead of "him". The reason I'm making this point is because when a tr=
anslation says "His number is 666", this would imply a singular person, the=
 Antichrist. But by saying "the number of it 666", implies that it is of th=
e beast system as a whole.<br />
<br />
We can know the number of the beast cannot be to identify products (like a =
new barcode) to buy or sell because scripture says we cannot buy or sell wi=
thout the number of the beast. What am I getting at? There will be instance=
s where you could buy something someone made themselves and it wouldn't hav=
e a store branded identification on it. But for this number to be in our ch=
ips, that is where it must be to conclude ultimately that we cannot buy or =
sell without having the number of the beast. As previously mentioned in Rev=
elation 13:18, the number of the beast (6+6+6=3D18) is a "human number", de=
finition "generically, to include all human individuals".<br />
<br />
May this be the title of the beast, the number of its name? The one-world b=
east system which is recognized by 18 characters? This might match the scri=
ptures that speaks of a mark that we ought to have to buy or sell in our ri=
ght-hand or forehead, and that it additionally consists of the number of th=
e beast, throughout a future cashless money society.<br />
<br />
Here is another mathematical confirmation: 144,000 divided by 6, divided by=
 6, divided by 6 (6,6,6) equals 666. To see many more of these amazing calc=
ulations, read the article about the RFID Mark of the Beast and the number =
666...<br />
<br />
Do we believe blind forces gave us eyes to see? That deaf forces gave us ea=
rs to hear? That careless forces gave us a heart to care for others? That f=
aithless forces uphold the universe and all the laws that govern it and tha=
t is why we should trust them? That mindless forces gave us a mind to think=
 and comprehend these things? If there is a God, He must be personal, becau=
se we as His creation are personal beings. How do we get to personally know=
 anybody? By their word...The words of Jesus have been translated into over=
 2,000 languages, and nothing comes remotely close (the Quran about 110). I=
f that is not God's word, nothing is. Why? Why would a personal loving God =
who desires for us to know Him, who is all powerful, allow man to create a =
word far surperior than His to be spread around the world throughout time i=
n so many different languages to deceive the world so we may not know the t=
ruth about Him?<br />
<br />
God has shown me some time ago that Trump will have a second term (he will =
be back soon!), and that this will be the time where the two witnesses of R=
evelation 11 will rise up (who are the 144,000) to prophesy for 42 months t=
o every tribe, tongue, nation and people before the beast rises from the se=
a in Revelation 13. We will see His Holy Spirit move across the world in a =
mighty way bringing a great multitude to God. God gave me a vision that Oba=
ma will be back in 2024.<br />

"Why did the Biden campaign choose 30330? 2020 divided by 666 =3D 3.0330 Wh=
o believes this to be a coincidence? October 2020 Isaiah 53:6 Someone said =
we are being whipsawed in 2020. Truly a great division is taking place betw=
een good and evil=E2=80=94both symbolically and literally (riots, unrest, p=
olitics). If you take the current year 2020 and divide it by the number 666=
 (known for its satanic implications) you will get the number 30330 (repeat=
ed). This number 30330 happens to be the number used to vote for Joe Biden =
and Kamala Harris. Freaky? Supernatural? Odd for sure. Whatever this means,=
 it doesn=E2=80=99t seem good to me. First, why would anyone knowingly choo=
se those particular numbers for their campaign? If they weren=E2=80=99t kno=
wingly chosen, then it appears to be a supernatural act by the evil one him=
self and I would want to change those numbers ASAP. And if the numbers were=
 chosen knowing their significance, are you satanic? Is this campaign satan=
ic? Either way I do not believe this is a coincidence. And one thing is cer=
tain, 2020 is truly being divided by Satan. He is the master deceiver and s=
preader of chaos. Jesus calls him the father of lies."<br />
<br />
So I looked up this number 30330 concerning Joe Biden, and I found this inf=
ormation:=C2=A0<br />
<br />
If you send a text to that number (at that time), you would get a response =
asking to support Joe's campaign to take down Donald Trump, with one part i=
n caps saying "CHIP IN >>" pointing to a link to go and donate.<br />
<br />
"CHIP IN"? Obama has used this phrase in the past on his twitter and people=
 believe it is a subliminal message to receive the mark of the beast, that =
is to say the implantable RFID microCHIP that will go IN our body.<br />
<br />
God's word warns us in the last days that a false prophet will stand up per=
forming miracles to deceive many to obtain the beasts mark:<br />
<br />
.."But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had perfor=
med the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had =
received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them wer=
e thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur" (Revelation 19:20 NIV=
)..<br />
<br />
At ALL COSTS, resist the mark!<br />
<br />
"Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone wor=
ships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on =
his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, whic=
h is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be =
tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in=
 the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever a=
nd ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his =
image, and whoever receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11).<br =
/>
<br />
We're living in very prophetic times with major Biblical prophecies coming =
to pass.<br />
<br />
When Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as capital of Israel on December 6 2=
017, this was a large step to bring about the Third Temple prophesied in th=
e Holy Bible.<br />
<br />
God's Holy scriptures warns us that the Antichrist will seat himself in thi=
s temple:<br />
<br />
"...and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and e=
xalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he=
 sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God" (2 Thess=
alonians 2:3-4).<br />
<br />
In the Islamic religion, there is a man known as the Mahdi, referred to as =
their messiah who they're awaiting to be revealed. There are various testim=
onies from people on line who consider this man will be Barack Obama who ma=
y be the biblical Antichrist. I personally have had unusual dreams (you can=
 read them in my article on the website above) about Barack Obama. He came =
on stage proclaiming himself to be a Christian with no affiliation to the M=
uslim faith, however it was later revealed by his circle of relatives that =
he indeed is a religious Muslim.<br />
<br />
So what's in the name? The meaning of someones name can say a lot about a p=
erson. God throughout history has given names to people that have a specifi=
c meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack Obama? Let us take=
 a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface...<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "And He said to them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from hea=
ven'" (Luke 10:18).<br />
<br />
In Hebrew, the word "Barack" means "lighting", and the usage of "Bama" (Str=
ongs Hebrew phrase 1116) is used to mean the "heights" of heaven.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
The following day after the election of Barack Obama (11/04/08), the winnin=
g choose three lotto numbers in Illinois (Obama=E2=80=99s domestic state) f=
or 11/5/08 were 666.<br />
<br />
Obama had been U.S. senator for the state of Illinois, and his zip code was=
 60606.<br />
<br />
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we were to=
 write those names backwards we would get "ailam ahsatan". Now if we remove=
 the letters that spell "Alah" (Allah being the God of Islam), we get "I am=
 Satan". Coincidence? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
These are just a few of many evidences why Barack Obama is the Antichrist. =
You can see many more in my article on the website above, as well as read a=
bout the dreams I've had concerning this man. I'm more than convinced that =
God has shown me that he is without a doubt the Antichrist, and we will see=
 him rise to power in the not so dinstant future.<br />
<br />
So, why do we need Jesus?<br />
<br />
"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 2:23).<br =
/>
<br />
"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Chri=
st Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).<br />
<br />
Our good works can't save our souls from the wrong we've committed. If we s=
tep before a judge in the court of law, being responsible of a crime, the j=
udge is not going to judge us by the good that we've carried out, but rathe=
r the crimes we've committed. If we as fallen humanity, created in God's im=
age, pose this type of justice, how much more a perfect, righteous, and Hol=
y God?<br />
<br />
God has introduced to us His ethical regulation's through the 10 commandmen=
ts given to Moses at Mt. Siani. These legal guidelines were not given so we=
 may be justified, but in order that we could see the need for a saviour. T=
hey are the mirror of God's character of what He has put in each of us, wit=
h our conscious bearing witness that we know that it's an act of evil to st=
eal, lie, dishonor our parents, and so forth.<br />
<br />
We can strive to observe all the ethical laws of the 10 commandments, but w=
e'll in no way catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That sam=
e word of the law given to Moses became flesh over 2000 years ago inside th=
e body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification by perfectly fulfil=
ling the commandments of God, living a sinless life that only God may accom=
plish.<br />
<br />
The space between us and the law can in no way be reconciled by our own mer=
it, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of God. An=
d if we are to seize hold of, through faith in Him, He'll pull us up being =
the one to justify us. As inside the court of law, if somebody steps in and=
 pays your debt, despite the fact that you're guilty, the judge can do what=
 is legal and just and allow you to go free. That is what Jesus did almost =
2000 years in the past on the cross. It was a legal transaction being fulfi=
lled inside the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood, with His last=
 words being, "...It is finished!..." (John 19:30).<br />
<br />
Now why did Jesus have to die for us?<br />
<br />
Because God is Holy and just, the wrath that we deserve could not be brushe=
d away. Through the perfect righteousness and justice of God's character, i=
t ought to be reconciled, it ought to be quenched and satisfied.<br />
<br />
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23). That =
is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming Messiah and His =
soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it satisfied God to crush =
His only begotten Son.<br />
<br />
That is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being poured out=
 upon His Son. For if it was poured out on us who've earned it, we would al=
l die and go to hell. God created a way of escape by pouring it out on His =
Son who's soul could not stay in Hades, but was raised and seated on the ri=
ght hand of God in power.<br />
<br />
Now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), God no longer see'=
s the individual who deserves His wrath, but rather the glorious image of H=
is perfect Son residing in our hearts, justifying us as if we obtained the =
wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the curse of death.<br />
<br />
Now what we ought to do is turn from our sins and believe in the saviour, c=
onfessing and forsaking our sins. That is not just a head knowledge of beli=
eving in Jesus, but rather receiving His words, taking them to heart. Where=
 we no longer live to practice sin, but turn from our sins and practice rig=
hteousness:<br />
<br />
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? =
Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor=
 homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor =
revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were s=
ome of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were just=
ified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Corint=
hians 6:9-11).<br />
<br />
By doing so we will become transformed into the image of God through faith =
in His Son Christ Jesus Who is willing to provide the Holy Spirit to those =
that ask of Him:<br />
<br />
"Most assuredly, I (Jesus) say to you, unless one is born of water and the =
Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh=
 is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel th=
at I said to you, 'You must be born again.' (John 3:5-6).<br />
<br />
"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of Go=
d dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is no=
t His" (Romans 8:9).<br />
<br />
Now what are you waiting for? Our heavenly Father only desires the best for=
 us, restoring everything this world has stolen from us. That is what it me=
ans to be "holy". To be made whole.<br />
<br />
He's waiting to hear from you. That God given tongue to speak language, by =
using faith, pray to Him, ask Him to forgive you by confessing your sins an=
d be willing to forsake them; that you receive the sacrifice of His Son Jes=
us on the cross, and that you want His Holy Spirit living inside you rework=
ing you into a child of God.<br />
<br />
Jesus says, "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him (the Hol=
y Spirit) will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will becom=
e in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."<br />
<br />
Did you know that Jesus spoke more about hell than anybody in the word of G=
od, even more than He spoke about heaven?! For this very purpose He came to=
 die for us, to rescue us from this place that we earned by our sins agains=
t a holy God.<br />
=C2=A0<br />
He describes hell as a real place where,<br />
<br />
"Their worm does not die<br />
And the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44).<br />
<br />
And where,<br />
<br />
"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth..." (Luke 13:28).<br />
<br />
Jesus tells us who to fear,<br />
<br />
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rath=
er fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:=
28).<br />
<br />
"Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first=
 earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the h=
oly city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a =
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying,=
 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, a=
nd they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God=
. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more=
 death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former=
 things have passed away.'<br />
<br />
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He=
 said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'<br />
<br />
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning=
 and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to hi=
m who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his=
 God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, mur=
derers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have th=
eir part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the seco=
nd death.'" (Revelation 21:1-8).<img width=3D"1" height=3D"1" src=3D"http:/=
