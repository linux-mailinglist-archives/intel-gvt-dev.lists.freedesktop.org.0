Dear Friend,

Good day to you and your family. I apologize if the content here-under are
contrary to your moral ethics but please treat with absolute secrecy and
personal.

My name is Mr. Sohal Arfan Latif. from Pakistan, but worked in Damascus,
Syria. I am 40 years Old. I am the Son to a personal investor, also an oil
Tycoon from Syria and Saudi Arabia: Al Furat Petroleum Company (AFPC), the
leader in the region in Reservoir Management.

AFPC was established under Service Contract no. 210 ratified by Law no. 43
of 1977 and named as per decree-law no. 12 in 1985. AFPC is a joint venture
company between the General Petroleum Corporation (50%) and private
shareholders Syria Shell Petroleum Development (SSPD) etc=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=A6

I am the only Son/Child of my parents. My Mother and Father died during the
escalation and climax of the Syrian war.

But before the war got out of hand, my Father(now late) moved some funds
into a bank in Burkina Faso, West Africa, for safety.

The amount that was moved to the bank was a total of $42.6Million USD. I
had applied to both banks for the release of the funds to me, so that I
could start a new business, but the bank Directors told me that my late
Father left a "Note"(WILL) in the form of conditions, that the banks Must
Not release the funds to me until I am of experienced age of investing the
funds into a very good business venture, and the "Will" also stated that I
should present an experienced business partner before the bank, who will
assist me in investing wisely. Having schooled in London and read Political
Science, I have no knowledge in business investment plan.

I am presently in a refuge camp in the United Kingdom.

This then brought me to the issue of searching for a reputable and
trustworthy person, who has vast experiences in profitable businesses,
where to invest the funds into.

I want to transfer this fund into your bank account in your country, so
that we could invest it wisely. I have contacted the Director of the bank
where the fund is deposited in Burkina Faso, and asked if the fund could be
loaded into an ATM VISA CARD and he said it is possible to load some of the
funds into an ATM VISA CARD, while most of it will be wired to your account
via online bank transfer.

Why I contacted you is that I want you to tell me more about good
investments, so that I will move this fund into your account in your
country so that I could relocate my investment plan to your country.

Tell me more about your country. How good it will be to invest in your
country Cities, Such as buying of properties, houses, real estate and
investments in tourism.

I will appreciate whatever result you may brief me. Do let me know your
idea and knowledge regarding these or any other profitable investment you
may suggest.

Take note; After the whole deal and the fund is released to us, You will be
rewarded with 20% of the total amount for your participation and also be
rewarded with 10% of any profit we invest the money into.

I shall tell you more about this transaction as soon as i get your
readiness concerning this transaction.

Waiting for your reply,

Thanks and best regards,
Mr. Sohal Arfan Latif.
