<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>

<FONT size=3>Series of meetings have been hold over the past 7 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. This ended 3 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your funds which is to the tune of $16.5million due to past corrupt Governmental Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reason and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the current Prime Minister of Malaysia Excellency Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to have receive their Contract Sum, Lottery/Gambling, Inheritance and the likes. Now how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have two method of payment which is by Bank Cashier Cheque or by Atm Card?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>
<FONT size=3>ATM CARD: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $5,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the Master Card Logo on it and the card have to be renewed in 4 years’ time which is 2025. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account Cashier Cheque will be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred option and would be mailed to you via FedEx. Because we have signed a contract with FedEx which should expire by the end of August 2020 you will only need to pay $280 instead of $420 saving you $140 so if you </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Pay before the one week you save $140 note that any one asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudsters and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any. Also remember that all you will ever have to spend is $280.00 nothing more! Nothing less! And we guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfully delivered to you within the next 24hrs after the receipt of payment has been confirmed.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Government of Malaysia, The United Nation and also the FBI and including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $280.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3>DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $420 but because FedEx have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees reduce from the actual fee of $420 to $280 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort! To effect the release of your fund valued at $16.5million you are advised to contact our correspondent in Asia the delivery officer </FONT></DIV>
