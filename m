<p><font face="Euphemia" style="font-size: 13pt">Greetings,<br>
<br>
I sent you an email regarding my “deceased Client” recently<br>
to this your email address, I was wondering if you had a chance<br>
to peruse through it? I understand that you are busy, but I would<br>
appreciate it if you could review this brief message and respond<br>
to me as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
My name is Francis John of the Global Financial Consultant.<br>
This proposal is strictly based on trust, a political class<br>
whose name was withheld from the Island due to strict note<br>
he left behind after his death. He left behind €55,000,000.00<br>
(Fifty Five Million Euros) for his retirement, he later died<br>
of Corvid in 2019.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
He had no next of Kin and I am contacting you today because<br>
you can inherit this fortune through some legal procedures if<br>
you can play the role of his next of Kin.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you accept this proposal half of the amount €55,000,000.00<br>
(Fifty five Million euro) will be transferred to you via wire<br>
transfer while the other half will be for the lawyer and I.<br>
If you are interested, kindly get back to me urgently so that<br>
I can explain to you all the relevant details for us to proceed<br>
with the legal binding documents.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I look forward to your quick response. Kindly reply to this my<br>
private email address <font color="#0000FF">francis.john@op.pl</font> with your 
contact<br>information, thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Francis John<br>
<b>Global Financial Consultant</b><br>
