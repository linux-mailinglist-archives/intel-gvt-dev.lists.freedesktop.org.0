I found some examples of using formatted string under /sys, mostly under
tracing. maybe we can do a similar implementation.

#cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm/kvm_mmio/format

name: kvm_mmio
ID: 32
format:
        field:unsigned short common_type;       offset:0;       size:2; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_flags;       offset:2;       size:1; signed:0;
        field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;       offset:3;       size:1; signed:0;
        field:int common_pid;   offset:4;       size:4; signed:1;

        field:u32 type; offset:8;       size:4; signed:0;
        field:u32 len;  offset:12;      size:4; signed:0;
        field:u64 gpa;  offset:16;      size:8; signed:0;
        field:u64 val;  offset:24;      size:8; signed:0;

print fmt: "mmio %s len %u gpa 0x%llx val 0x%llx", __print_symbolic(REC->type, { 0, "unsatisfied-read" }, { 1, "read" }, { 2, "write" }), REC->len, REC->gpa, REC->val

what about making all comparing fields vendor specific?
userspace like openstack only needs to parse and compare if target
device is within source compatible list without understanding the meaning
of each field.

what about a migration_compatible attribute under device node like
below?

#cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:02.0/UUID1/migration_compatible
SELF:
	device_type=pci
	device_id=8086591d
	mdev_type=i915-GVTg_V5_2
	aggregator=1
	pv_mode="none+ppgtt+context"
	interface_version=3
COMPATIBLE:
	device_type=pci
	device_id=8086591d
	mdev_type=i915-GVTg_V5_{val1:int:1,2,4,8}
	aggregator={val1}/2
	pv_mode={val2:string:"none+ppgtt","none+context","none+ppgtt+context"} 
	interface_version={val3:int:2,3}
COMPATIBLE:
	device_type=pci
	device_id=8086591d
	mdev_type=i915-GVTg_V5_{val1:int:1,2,4,8}
	aggregator={val1}/2
	pv_mode=""  #"" meaning empty, could be absent in a compatible device
	interface_version=1


#cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:02.0/UUID2/migration_compatible
SELF:
	device_type=pci
	device_id=8086591d
	mdev_type=i915-GVTg_V5_4
	aggregator=2
	interface_version=1
COMPATIBLE: 
	device_type=pci
	device_id=8086591d
	mdev_type=i915-GVTg_V5_{val1:int:1,2,4,8}
	aggregator={val1}/2
	interface_version=1


Notes:
- A COMPATIBLE object is a line starting with COMPATIBLE.
  It specifies a list of compatible devices that are allowed to migrate
  in.
  The reason to allow multiple COMPATIBLE objects is that when it
  is hard to express a complex compatible logic in one COMPATIBLE
  object, a simple enumeration is still a fallback.
  in the above example, device UUID2 is in the compatible list of
  device UUID1, but device UUID1 is not in the compatible list of device
  UUID2, so device UUID2 is able to migrate to device UUID1, but device
  UUID1 is not able to migrate to device UUID2.

- fields under each object are of "and" relationship to each other,  meaning
  all fields of SELF object of a target device must be equal to corresponding
  fields of a COMPATIBLE object of source device, otherwise it is regarded as not
  compatible.

- each field, however, is able to specify multiple allowed values, using
  variables as explained below.

- variables are represented with {}, the first appearance of one variable
  specifies its type and allowed list. e.g.
  {val1:int:1,2,4,8} represents var1 whose type is integer and allowed
  values are 1, 2, 4, 8.

- vendors are able to specify which fields are within the comparing list
  and which fields are not. e.g. for physical VF migration, it may not
  choose mdev_type as a comparing field, and maybe use driver name instead.
 

Thanks
Yan
