My Dear Beneficiary,

I am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise, since we have
never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to
choose you among the numerous internet users in the world. Your email
address came up in a random draw conducted by Vodafone Group plc charity
fundraising support, I cannot say Why I have chosen you but do not be
worried because we have made our random draw and your e-mail address was
picked to receive this charity fund as the beneficiary of my (LAST WILL)
which has made me accomplish my request. May the almighty God bless and
see you through with this mission. Please carefully read and digest the
message below.

Before I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography,
My name is Mother Coris Whent, 84 Years old, Founder of Whent Family
Foundation and wife to Late Sir, Gerald Arthur "Gerry" Whent, founder
and former chief executive of Vodafone Group plc. After the death of my
husband I became the Head of his investment and now that I am old and
weak I have decided to spend the rest of my life with my family and
loved ones whom I never had time for during the course of my business
life, but before the death of my husband we had a plan to use the last
days of our lives to donate half of what we have worked for to the less
privilege and charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family
members and close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is
not alive today to do this with me and I am very weak and old now, hence
I have decided to do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late
husband and I.

I have presently deposited a Cheque in the sum of (FIVE MILLION UNITED
STATES DOLLARS) with ING Bank N.V to be transfer to you, what you have
to do now is to contact Mr. Tanate Phutrakul the (CFO of ING Groep and
ING Bank N.V) as soon as possible to know when they will transfer or
deliver your cheque to you because of the expiring date of the Cheque. I
only made the deposit with your EMAIL ADDRESS and the DEPOSIT CODE is
(ING_55519724_WFP). I have paid for the Full Insurance Premium of the
Cheque deposit to ING Bank, showing that it is not a Drug Fund or Fund
meant to sponsor Terrorism in your Country. Let me repeat again, you are
not to pay for the Insurance Premium of the Cheque to ING Bank because I
have already paid for them.

I am sorry to inform you that you may not have the chance to meet me
because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have
agreed upon before his death and you happened to be the beneficiary of
my (LAST WILL) donation, irrespective of your previous financial status,
hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that will cost
you nothing. PLEASE MY DEAR, IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL NOT USE THIS
MONEY FOR BETTERMENT OF THE POOR IN YOUR SOCIETY, please do not contact
me or the Mr. Tanate Phutrakul, please i need someone that will help me
distribute this money generously to the less privilege in their
communities.

Kindly contact Mr. Tanate Phutrakul, with Your Full Names: Your Postal
address; Your Direct telephone number; for transfer of the Cheque to
you.

Contact Person: Mr. Tanate Phutrakul
E-mail: cfo@ing-tanate.com
Tel: +44 7451280367

Note: Please I do not want you to thank me or our family, all I need you
to do is to invest wisely and do the same good to someone's life someday
as this is the only way this world would be a better community if we
render selfless services to one another especially in this period of
Covid-19 pandemic. GOD BLESS YOU!

Yours Faithfully
Mrs. Coris Whent
(c) 2021 Whent Family Foundation.
