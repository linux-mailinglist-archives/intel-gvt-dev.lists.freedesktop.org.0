Dear Friend,

My name is Mr Shwe Aung, l am working with a Bank here in Myanmar as a manager. I discovered a dormant
account with a big sum of fund $9,600,0000 USD, that belongs to a late customer that bears the same last name with yours.

I want to use my position to present you as the legitimate next of kin and beneficiary of this funds
which will be transferred to you as the next of kin to the deceased.
We shall talk more on sharing percentage, for more details email me immediately,
i Looking forward to hear from you.

Best Regard,
Mr Shwe.
