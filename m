Hello Dear,

I am.Stella Fabio,I have sent you two emails and you did not respond, I even sent another one few days ago with more details still no response, please are you still using this email address? I am VERY SORRY if sincerely you did not receive those emails.I am Stella Fabio, An Italian national,I was browsing and I saw your email, So i decided to write to you if your email is real, I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live. I am rich, but was never generous; I have given most of my assets to my immediate family members.

I have decided to give alms to charity organizations. I can not do this myself anymore because of my health. and my family can not allow me to give some money to charity organizations, they refused and kept the money.I have a fixed deposit of Eighteen Million euros with a finance firm,I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. You will take out 30% of these funds for your assistance.Please if you can be sincere to assist me to collect this fund and distribute it kindly reply to me with your full names and full address also your telephone numbers.
My Private is email is stellafabio001@outlook.com
I will like you to acknowledge the receipt of this electronic message as soon as
possible and treated with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Mrs Stella Fabio
