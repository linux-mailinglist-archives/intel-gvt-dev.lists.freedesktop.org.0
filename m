Dear Beloved,


I am Mrs.Patricia  vanpe  from Belgium married to Late Mr.Hassan Armed Husameddine of Indonesia who was an oil merchandise for many years in so many country before he died in the year 2013. my late husband made a substantial deposit of 19Million Euro with a bank In Europe before the wicked death took him away and since then i have been battling with disease which recently doctor just  told me that i have few months to live but what bothers me more is that i have no child of my own and my late husband brothers has been threatening me bad so i decided to use this fund for charity purpose.


Please for God sake get back to me so i will explain more and tell you how to go about it and your own percentage on the fund but mind you its aim is to propagate the name of God with the fund once it gets to you.


Yours in sister

Mrs. Patricia vanpe
