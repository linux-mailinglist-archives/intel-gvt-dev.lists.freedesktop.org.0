Dear Friend
I am Mr. Wilson Brand, a financial consultant, bringing to your notice a business proposal.

A well-known minister in one of the African countries who is undergoing financial queries by the Authority over alleged mismanaged of contract funds worth over five billion dollars has contacted me to help him move a transit funds amounting to US$ 76 Million dollars.

He has advised that the funds be moved from its present position to a reliable hand and be used for any lucrative investment abroad. I am contacting you based on the information I already given to him that I have a reliable hand to handle the investment funds, but the person I had in mind unknown to me passed away due to Covid-19 complication as I was reliably informed.

Therefore, I am contacting you to know if you are able to handle this matter by receiving and investing the funds under a 60/40 sharing ratio of the capital and the investment annual returns.

If you are interested to handle the transaction, kindly contact me through this email address ( brawillson94@gmail.com) for more detail
Regards

Mr. Wilson Brand
