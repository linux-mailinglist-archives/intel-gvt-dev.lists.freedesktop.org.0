Dear esteemed customer

RE: FINAL NOTICE!

Subject matter, acknowledgment of your death, the sole beneficiary and order to change of banking details

We received a new payment order dated April 19, 2024, to transfer the sum of $5,000,000.00 USD plus accrued interest of $50,000 USD, totaling $5,050,000.00 USD, to you. We sent two different email notifications to you a few weeks ago regarding this new development, and it's surprising that we haven't received any acknowledgement emails from you up until this time. I am sending you this email again as a reminder and to have your consent regarding the authorization letter we received from barrister Wang, Li, Zhang, and Liu with a copy of United States Passport No. 498206725 and was in the company of other counsels who undoubtedly claimed to be your representatives. I am requesting that you personally consent to this claim by barrister Wang, Li, Zhang, and Liu, who equally submitted a bank account with the HSBC Bank as your legally acceptable receiving bank details for the fund transfer. Please confirm the stated account details below, as we noticed that the account name is not your nam
 e:

Bank Name: HSBC Bank.
Bank Address: 452 5th Ave, New York, NY 10018, United States
Account number: 301896710676
Swift Code: MRMDUS33
Account Name: Abbas Abdullah Ali.
Address: 16820 6th Avenue WLynnwood, WA 98037, USA


It is our banking rules that we must have direct email or telephone contact with the fund beneficiary first before we can finally release the fund; therefore, I am officially contacting you directly on this authorization letter and the new bank account details submitted by barrister Wang, Li, Zhang, Liu for the remittance of your $5,050,000.00 USD.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your prompt answer.

Best Regards

Alex YVES
