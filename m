Hi,<br /> <br /> How are you doing?<br /> Have you read the information on
the workplace foosball table that we previously supplied to you? <br />
This product is now available from our warehouse.<br /> I'm going to
present you with the product information once again right now.<br /> <br />
This table includes 22 players, a green playground, two manual scorers, and
a football field that has been restored to its former glory.<br /> Keeping
hydrated when the competition heats up is made easy thanks to two cup
holders. <br />Rod bars provide comfortable grips that help to avoid hand
slippage and improve ball control (2 balls included) A total of two balls
are included in the set.<br /> MDF Fiberboard is a product that is
favorable to the environment. When it comes to the building of our football
table, <br />we employ high-quality MDF fiberboard.<br /> Stability is
provided by four robust legs with non-slip footings.<br /> <br /> In fact,
a single table can give hours of game enjoyment for one or two people.<br
/> If you have a playroom or an extra room in your home, this table will be
a perfect addition. <br />It is really light and easy to move around in.
This is an excellent option for you.<br /> <br /> MDF (Carb P2) and plastic
are used to construct it.<br /> The size of the product is determined by
the product (48 x 24 x 30)<br /> "This piece has the following dimensions:
121.92 x 61 x 77.5 cm (L x W x H) and weighs 21.5kg / 47.40lbs (325.16 x
35.6)."<br /> The artwork has the following measurements: 128x66x14mm (L x
W x H)<br /> One set is contained within each carton.<br /> <br /> Prices:

this table, as well as a green playing area and two goalkeepers who use
manual controls.<br /> Design that is compatible with a wide variety of
devices. Additionally, soft grips are included on the rod bars to aid with
ball control and<br /> to prevent the rod bars from slipping out of the
hands during play (2 balls included) Two balls are included in the
price.<br /> MDF Fiberboard that is environmentally friendly: Our football
table is constructed of high-quality, durable MDF fiberboard.<br /> Each
leg, which is supported by four sturdy legs, is stabilized by an adjustable
non-slip foundation.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> Edgar Avila</p>
