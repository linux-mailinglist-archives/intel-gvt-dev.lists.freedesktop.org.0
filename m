ffering from long time (illness) cancer of the bone (leukemia). This illnes=
s has troubled me for a long time. All indications from my doctor and medic=
al analysis is that, my condition is really deteriorating and getting worse=
; and it is quite obvious that I will not live more than three OR Four mont=
hs, although it is God who decides. This is because the cancer disease has =
gotten to a very bad stage that there is no hope for me to be living again.=

process goodly. I am willing to donate the sum of GBP=A312.5, million Briti=

ds (=A33,750,000GBP) as your compensation for helping me fulfill this desir=
