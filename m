<DIV>
Greetings With all due respect,</DIV>
<DIV>
I want you to read my letter with one mind and help me. I am Lana Lea Ruddick , The only daughter of late Mr. and Mrs Ruddick, My Late father was a very wealthy cocoa dealer in Lome Togo before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outing to discuss on a business deal.</DIV>
<DIV>
my mother died when she was given birth to me,since then my father took me so special because I am motherless. Before the death of my late father (on 2nd) June 2021 in a private hospital here in Lome Togo. He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of USD5, 000,000.00</DIV>
<DIV>
five million United States dollars left in a suspense account in a local bank here in Lome Togo, that he used my name as his only daughter for the next of kin in deposit of the fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates that I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose, such as real estate agent,</DIV>
<DIV>
I am 17 year old. Dear I am honorably seeking your assistance in the following ways.</DIV>
<DIV>
1) To provide any bank account where this money would be transferred into.</DIV>
<DIV>
2) To serve as the guardian of this fund.</DIV>
<DIV>
3) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.</DIV>
<DIV>
Moreover, I am willing to (offer you 35) percent of the total sum as compensation for your effort input after the successful transfer of this fund to your nominated account overseas.</DIV>
<DIV>
I want you to help me not because of the 35 percent I want to offer you but to take me as your adoptive child and take good care of my life. Please save my life.</DIV>
<DIV>
Hope to hear from you immediately for more details for you to receive the money so that I can be coming to your country immediately after you have receive the money so that I can continue my education while this money will be invested by you.</DIV>
<DIV>
Thanks and God Bless.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp; Best Regards</DIV>
<DIV>
Lana Lea Ruddick</DIV>
