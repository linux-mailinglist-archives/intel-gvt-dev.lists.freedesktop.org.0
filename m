BEST REGARDS,

This mail may be a surprise to you because you did not give me the
permission to do so and neither do you know me but before I tell you about
myself I want you to please forgive me for sending this mail without your
permission. I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is
the will of God for you to help me and my family, God  almighty will bless
and reward you abundantly. I need an honest and trustworthy person like
you to entrust this huge transfer project unto.

My name is Mr Paul Owusu, The Branch Manager of a Financial Institution. I
got your contact through a reliable source called database through Ghana
chamber of commerce. I am a Ghanaian married with 3 kids. I am writing to
solicit your assistance in the transfer of US$15,500,000.00 Dollars. This
fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager made as
profit this half year (ie 2025 financial year). After I submitted an
annual half year report for this 2025 on the 6th June 2025 to my head
office in Accra-Ghana, I watched with keen interest as they never knew of
this excess. I placed this amount of US$15,500,000.00 Dollars on an Escrow
Coded account without a beneficiary (Anonymous) to avoid a trace.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money
thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money
into your bank account on my behalf. I agree that 40% of this money will
be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign
account, and 60% would be for me and I will join you in your country once
the fund arrives in your account for an investment plan. I do need to
stress that there is practically no risk involved in this.

It's going to be a bank-to-bank transfer OR E-online Transfer. All I need
from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund so that the
fund can be transferred to your account.

If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to me.
This is why and the only reason why I contacted you, I am willing to go
into partnership investment with you owing to your wealth of experience,
So please if you are interested in assisting on this venture kindly
contact me back for a brief discussion on how to proceed.

Best regards,
Mr Paul Owusu,
