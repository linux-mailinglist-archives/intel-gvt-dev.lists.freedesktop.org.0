Hi,<br /> <br /> How are you getting along?<br /> Have you taken the time
to read the information regarding the drone that was sent to you earlier
today?<br /> I'll email you the specifics about the product once more.
Thanks for your patience.<br /> <br /> The drone's battery lasts for 30
minutes on a charge. <br /> There is a 1000m safety barrier between the
electric fence and the surrounding area.<br /> GPS position is outside the
optical flow fixed point, but inside the optical flow fixed point.<br />
Return to your home on a low power setting by using the power off/off
signal.<br /> In addition to follow and surround modes, as well as
multi-point cruises, VR mode, as well as multi-lens switching and panoramic
photo/video recording, are also available options.<br /> Included are
several useful functions such as the MV (multi-view) mode, one-button
return to the home screen, headless mode, definition switching, gesture
photo/video, and the ability to adjust the front lens up and down.<br />
Level of wind resistance: 8. (high wind resistance)<br /> The fan blades
have a diameter of approximately 5.8 cm (in centimeters).<br /> With the
board, the battery has a capacity of 7.4V 3000mAh.<br /> It is equipped
with a remote control that can be used to recharge the battery if
necessary. <br /> When it comes to batteries, capacity is essential (with
charging)<br /> Drone dimensions: When fully unfurled, the finished size is
26x30x5cm.<br /> <br /> Pricing:<br /> One drone is 289.90<br /> Two drones
is 279.90 each<br /> For three drones, 265.80 each<br /> <br /> Interested
in taking one or two for this weekend? Please let me know.<br /> Send us
your shipment location, and we'll get in touch with logistics to make
arrangements for you.<br /><br /><br /><img

and GPS positioning located outside, optical flow is created.<br /> When
you return to your home, the power goes out, or you receive a signal
indicating that the energy has been shut off.<br /> In addition to virtual
reality mode and multi-lens switching, this camera also has video/picture
panorama and a video/picture panorama.<br /> There are other modes,
including MV (with a single key for returning to the home screen),
headless, photo/video gestures, and front lens adjustment.<br /> The
GPS/air pressure combination used in the fixed altitude flight system is a
mixture of the two.<br /> Wind resistance is wind resistance level of 8)<br
/><br />Interested in taking one or two for this weekend? Please let me
know.<br />Send us your shipment location, and we'll get in touch with
logistics to make arrangements for you.<br /><br /> Thanks,<br /> Eric
