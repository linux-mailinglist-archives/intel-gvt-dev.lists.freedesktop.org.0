Greetings to you and your family.

My name is Mrs Jennifer Kate, i am undergoing medical treatment here in Fra=
nce. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer of the throat which was d=
iscovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. I was marrie=
d to Dr. John Kate who worked as a director with the uk Railway Commission =
for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2022. We were m=
arried for twenty one years without a child. He died after a brief illness =
that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth=
 for the less privileged in the society. Since his death I decided not to r=
e-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.  However, I adopted a s=
on by name Ali from South Africa who is 17 years old.

My husband and I deposited the sum of US$50,5 Million (Fifty million five h=
undred thousand dollar) in a usa bank. and now that my Doctor made it clear=
 to me that I would not last long due to my health that has resulted in str=
oke, I hereby seek for the assistance of an honest and God fearing person t=
o assist me distribute this funds to orphanages, and those affected in the =
Tsunami in far Asia.

I took this decision because my adopted son is still small and my husband's=
 relatives are not inclined to help poor people, they are only after the mo=
ney and I do not want my husband's hard earned money to be misused or spent=
 in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. I do not want them=
 to know about this development, this is why i am contacting an external pe=
rson and also i cannot carry this out because of my condition.

As soon as I receive your reply I will introduce you as my partner, and sha=
ll give you the contact of the bank where the funds are deposited. I will a=
lso issue you a letter of authority and all other documents that will empow=
er you as the next beneficiary.

You will be compensated with 20% of the total fund for your kind assistance.

P.S: You might receive this message in your inbox; spam or junk folders dep=
ending on your web host or server network. I will be waiting for your reply.

I expect your reply immediately,

Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.
Yours sincerely,
Mrs. Jennifer Kate
