I am Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the acting Chairman, Federal Trade Commission. 

As the economic and catastrophic impact of the Corona Virus pandemic continues to hit hard on individuals and small businesses, the Federal Trade Commission has been contracted by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve Board to expedite the release of all outstanding compensation/inheritance/relief funds owed to individuals and small businesses and be sure that all funds are paid to befitting beneficiaries this year.

Due to this development, we have been assigned to step into the immediate processing of all outstanding payments to enable all beneficiaries receive their funds as soon as possible. Fortunately, you have been selected alongside a few other beneficiaries to receive a payment of $950,000 (Nine Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars only) through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

To implement this, you are to get back to me immediately with the below details;

(1) Full Names:
(2) Residential Address:
(3) Date of Birth:
(4) Phone/Cell Number:
(5) Occupation:

In conclusion, it's my concern to demand your ultimate honesty and cooperation to enable us expedite this transaction. I guarantee that this process would be executed under a legitimate arrangement that would legally protect you from any breach of Law.

Get back to me at your earliest convenience.
