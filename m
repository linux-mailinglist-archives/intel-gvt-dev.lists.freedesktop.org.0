You haven’t responded yet, I hope you received my previous<br>
email to you? Please take few minutes of your time to read this<br>message and 
your quick response is urgently needed if you are<br> still alive and in control of this 
your email to avoid releasing<br> your money to wrong person.<br>
<br>
I am Mrs. Christine P. Katziff, the newly-sworn Chief Audit Executive<br>
Of Bank Of America. You will get more information about me here:<br>
<font color="#0000FF">https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/christine-katziff</font><br>
<br>
On behalf of the entire staff of the Bank Of America and the US<br>
Government in collaboration with IMF and CIA. We apologize for the<br>
delay of your Outstanding Payments, Contract Payment, Winning or<br>
Inheritance funds valued $36.5 Million Dollars from most of African<br>
Countries and all the inconveniences you encountered while pursuing<br>
this payment. However, from the records of Outstanding beneficiaries<br>
due for payment with the Bank of America, your name was discovered as<br>
next on the list of the outstanding payment who has not yet received<br>
their payments.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, after due scrutiny and verification, I confirmed that you<br>
have fulfilled all the necessary obligations that will enable the<br>
release of your payment to you, but yet your payment was not released<br>
to you due to one flimsy excuses or the other from the Bank officials<br>
in charge of your payment, because they had the intention of diverting<br>
your funds to their private accounts in order to satisfy their selfish<br>
interest.<br>
<br>
I wish to inform you now that the square peg is now in square hole and<br>
your payment is being processed and will be released to you as soon as<br>
you respond to this letter. note that from the record in my file, your<br>
outstanding contract payment is US$36,500,000.00 (Thirty Six Million<br>
Five hundred thousand Dollars). Kindly re-confirm to me the<br>
followings:<br>
<br>
Your Full Name: ___<br>
Your Full Contact Address: __<br>
Country: _____<br>
Your Mobile Telephone Number: ______<br>
Working Identity /Passport: _____<br>
AGE: _______<br>
OCCUPATION: _____<br>
<br>
Please do provide the above information accurately, because this<br>
office cannot afford to be held liable for any wrong transfer of funds<br>
or liability of funds credited into an unknown account. As soon as the<br>
above mentioned details are received, your payment will be made to you<br>
immediately, you are advised to re-confirm to us your receiving bank<br>
account details, where you want your fund to be remitted. We await<br>
your swift response and also advise that if our directives are<br>
followed carefully, you should have your fund in your account within<br>
24 hours.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
