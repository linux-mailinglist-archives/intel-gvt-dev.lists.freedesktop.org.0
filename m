(As I've said in the previous discussion, off one of the patch series)

My view is it makes sense to have a half-way house on the opaqueness of
this string; I'd expect to have an ID and version that are human
readable, maybe a device ID/name that's human interpretable and then a
bunch of other cruft that maybe device/vendor/version specific.

I'm thinking that we want to be able to report problems and include the
string and the user to be able to easily identify the device that was
complaining and notice a difference in versions, and perhaps also use
it in compatibility patterns to find compatible hosts; but that does
get tricky when it's a 'ask the device if it's compatible'.
