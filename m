please Dear i need your urgent reply

Please bear with me. I am writing this letter to you with tears and sorrow
from my heart.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled president of
Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. I know my mail might come

to you as a surprise because you don=E2=80=99t know me, but due to the unso=
licited
nature of my situation here in Refugee camp Ouagadougou

Burkina Faso i decided to contact you for help. I have passed through pains
and sorrowful moments since the death of my father. At the

same time, my family is the target of Western nations led by Nato who want
to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and bank

accounts in several countries are their targets to freeze.

My Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $27.5M (Twenty Seven
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a Bank at Burkina

Faso which he used my name as the next of kin. I have been commissioned by
the (BOA) bank to present an interested foreign

investor/partner who can stand as my trustee and receive the fund in his
account for a possible investment in his country due to my

refugee status here in Burkina Faso.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me and stand
as my trustee so that I will present him to the Bank for the

transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to contact
you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my

trust but rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this
transaction interests you, you don't have to disclose it to anybody because

of what is going on with my entire family, if the United nation happens to
know this account, they will freeze it as they freeze others, so

please keep this transaction only to yourself until we finalize it.

Sorry for my pictures. I will enclose it in my next mail and more about me
when I hear from you okay.

Yours Sincerely
Best Regard,
Aisha Gaddafi
