Hi Alex, Jason,

could be this reason. So let me try to gather the changes of this series
does and the impact as far as I know.

1) only check the ownership of opened devices in the dev_set
     in HOT_RESET ioctl.
     - Impact: it changes the relationship between _INFO  and HOT_RESET.
       As " Each group must have IOMMU protection established for the
       ioctl to succeed." in [1], existing design actually means userspace
       should own all the affected groups before heading to do HOT_RESET.
       With the change here, the user does not need to ensure all affected
       groups are opened and it can do hot-reset successfully as long as th=
e
       devices in the affected group are just un-opened and can be reset.

845.21923.64284.stgit@bling.home/

2) Allow passing zero-length fd array to do hot reset
    - Impact: this uses the iommufd as ownership check in the kernel side.
      It is only supposed to be used by the users that open cdev instead of
      users that open group. The drawback is that it cannot cover the noiom=
mu
      devices as noiommu does not use iommufd at all. But it works well for
      most cases.

3) Allow hot reset be successful when the dev_set is singleton
     - Impact: this makes sense but it seems to mess up the boundary betwee=
n
     the group path and cdev path w.r.t. the usage of zero-length fd approa=
ch.
     The group path can succeed to do hot reset even if it is passing an em=
pty
     fd array if the dev_set happens to be singleton.

4) Allow passing device fd to do hot reset
    - Impact: this is a new way for hot reset. should have no impact.

5) Extend the _INFO to report devid
    - Impact: this changes the way user to decode the info reported back.
    devid and groupid are returned per the way the queried device is opened=
.
    Since it was suggested to support the scenario in which some devices
    are opened via cdev while some devices are opened via group. This makes
    us to return invalid_devid for the device that is opened via group if
    it is affected by the hot reset of a device that is opened via cdev.
   =20
    This was proposed to support the future device fd passing usage which i=
s
    only available in cdev path.

To me the major confusion is from 1) and 3). 1) changes the meaning of
_INFO and HOT_RESET, while 3) messes up the boundary.

Here is my thought:

For 1), it was proposed due to below reason[2]. We'd like to make a scenari=
o
that works in the group path be workable in cdev path as well. But IMHO, we
may just accept that cdev path cannot work for such scenario to avoid sublt=
e
change to uapi. Otherwise, we need to have another HOT_RESET ioctl or a
hint in HOT_RESET ioctl to tell the kernel  whether relaxed ownership check
is expected. Maybe this is awkward. But if we want to keep it, we'd do it
with the awareness by user.

For 3), it was proposed when discussing the hot reset for noiommu[3]. But
it does not make hot reset always workable for noiommu in cdev, just in
case dev_set is singleton. So it is more of a general optimization that can
make the kernel skip the ownership check. But to make use of it, we may
need to test it before sanitizing the group fds from user or the iommufd
check. Maybe the dev_set singleton test in this series is not well placed.
If so, I can further modify it.
