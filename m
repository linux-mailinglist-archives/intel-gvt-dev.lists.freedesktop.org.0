I suggested below that the owership require enough open devices - so
it doesn't "extend ownership opportunistically", and there is no
havoc.

Management tools already need to understand dev_set if they want to
offer reliable reset support to the VMs. Same as today.

Sure, and we can keep that with this approach.

We can decide the policy for the kernel to accept a claim. I suggested
below "same as today" - it must hold all the groups within the
iommufd_ctx.

The main point is to make this claiming operation qemu needs to do
clearer and more explicit. I view this as better than trying to guess
if it successfully made the claim by inspecting the _INFO output.

Same logic holds here

Ownership is claimed same as today by having all groups representated
in the iommufd_ctx. This seems just as clear as today.

IMHO we should try to avoid needing to expose group_id specifically to
userspace. We are missing a way to learn the "same ioas" restriction
in iommufd, and it should provide that directly based on dev_ids.

Otherwise if we really really need group_id then iommufd should
provide an ioctl to get it. Let's find a good reason first

no-iommu doesn't and shouldn't have iommu_groups either. It also
doesn't have an IOAS so querying for same-IOAS is not necessary.

The simplest option for no-iommu is to require it to pass in every
device fd to the reset ioctl.

No, we are trying to keep things pretty much the same as today without
resorting to exposing a lot of group related concepts.

The reset group is a clear concept that already exists and isn't
exposed. If we really need to know about it then it should be exposed
on its own, as a seperate discussion from this cdev stuff.

I want to re-focus on the basics of what cdev is supposed to be doing,
because several of the idea you suggested seem against this direction:

 - cdev does not have, and cannot rely on vfio_groups. We enforce this
   by compiling all the vfio_group infrastructure out. iommu_groups
   continue to exist.
   
   So converting a cdev to a vfio_group is not an allowed operation.

 - no-iommu should not have iommu_groups. We enforce this by compiling
   out all the no-iommu vfio_group infrastructure.

 - cdev APIs should ideally not require the user to know the group_id,
   we should try hard to design APIs to avoid this.

We have solved every other problem but reset like this, I would like
to get past reset without compromising the above.
