Hi,

My name is Paul Tekia, I work in the accounting and purchase department of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC) our division is mainly into research, purchase and production.

I am personally contacting you base on a business that I feel will be beneficial to both of us. Majority of the ingredients used in production by the agency are procured from Australia, Asia, America and Middle East, which is the reason why I am contacting you.

Santalum Spicatum Nopid Oil,  is one of the most expensive raw materials in our Integrative  production and is not risky or illegal product by any country law as it’s used in the formation various chemical for industrial and farmers use.

Formerly, our company purchased it from a Ukraine  based supplier until we lost him to death this March, but the product are found in your country which is the same place where the Ukrainian supplier sourced from, I confidentially got the contact of the local dealer in your country and I came to know that this product is sold at a cheaper rate $12,300 from your country but it is supplied to our company at the rate of$23,300 per gallon. I have the contact of the local dealer of which I don't want to release to my director since I have personal interest in the business.

Sir, I am looking out for a reliable and competent business person that I can trust, who will be able to bridge the gap between the local vendor and our company and have the product supply directly after receiving advance payment, without letting anyone in our ministry know the source and the value price of the product, after the supply,  the profit  will be shared  between us  60% to you 40% for me, that is my interest in the business

If you are interested, could you kindly leave your phone/whats app number for effective and enhance communication that will lead to a better understanding of the business. Please consider it urgent as your delay may prompt me to   search elsewhere.


Thanks.


Yours sincerely,



Paul Tekia.
