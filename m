ya this would work.
nova specificly the libvirt driver trys to avoid reading sysfs directly if libvirt
has an api that provides the infomation but where it does not it can read it and that
structure  woudl be easy for use to consume.

libs like os-vif which cant depend on libvirt use it a little more
for example to look up a PF form one of its VFs
https://github.com/openstack/os-vif/blob/master/vif_plug_ovs/linux_net.py#L384-L391

we are carefult not to over use sysfs as it can change over time based on kernel version in somecase
but its is genernal seen a preferable to calling an every growing list of comnnadline clients to retrive
the same info.

i think i prefer the nested directories to this flatend styple but there isnent really any significant increase
in complexity form a bash scripting point of view if i was manually debuging something the multi layer reprentation is
slight simpler to work with but not enough so that it really matters.

if it is doing a raw passthough like that 1 it will break users if a vendor every
removes a trait or renames it as part of a firwmware update and second it will require them to use
CUSTOM_ triant in stead of standardised traits. in other words is an interoperatbltiy problem between clouds.

at present cyborg does not support mdevs
there is a proposal for adding a generic mdev driver for generic stateless devices.
it could report arbitary capablity to placment although its does not exsit yet so its kind of premature ot point
to it as an example

currently the only use of mdevs in openstack is for vGPU with nvidia devices.
in theory intel gpus can work with the existing code but it has not been tested.

> created before migration?
the mdevs are currently created dynamically when a vm is created based on a set of pre defiend
flavor which have static metadata in the form of flavor extra_specs.
thost extra specs request a vgpu by spcifying resouces:VGPU=1 in the extra specs.
e.g. openstack flavor set vgpu_1 --property "resources:VGPU=1"
if you want a specific vgpu type then you must request a custom trait in addtion to the resouce class
openstack --os-placement-api-version 1.6 trait create CUSTOM_NVIDIA_11
openstack flavor set --property trait:CUSTOM_NVIDIA_11=required vgpu_1

when configuring the host for vGPUs you list the enabled vgpu mdev types and the device that can use them

   [devices]
   enabled_vgpu_types = nvidia-35, nvidia-36

   [vgpu_nvidia-35]
   device_addresses = 0000:84:00.0,0000:85:00.0

   [vgpu_nvidia-36]
   device_addresses = 0000:86:00.0

each device that is listed will be created as a resouce provider in the plamcent service
so to associate the custom trait with the physical gpu and mdev type you manually tag the RP withthe trait

openstack --os-placement-api-version 1.6 resource provider trait set \
    --trait CUSTOM_NVIDIA_11 e2f8607b-0683-4141-a8af-f5e20682e28c

this decouple the name of the CUSTOM_ trait form the underliying mdev type
so the operator is free to use small|medium|large or bronze|silver|gold if they want to or they coudld chose to use the
mdev_type name if they want too.

currently we dont support live migration with vGPU because the required code has not been upstream to qemu/kvm
yet? i belive it just missed the kernel 5.7 merge window? i know its in flight but have not been following too closely

if you do a cold/offline migration currenlty and you had multiple mdev types then technical the mdev type could change.
we had planned for operators to ensure that what ever trait they choose would map to the same mdev type on all hosts.
if we were to supprot live migration in the future without this new api we are disccusing we woudl make the trait to
mdev type relationship required to be 1:1 for live migration.

we have talked auto creating traits for gvpus which would be in the form of CUSTOM_<mdev type> but shyed away from it
as we are worried vendors will break us and our user by changing mdev_types in frimware updates or driver updates.
we kind of need to rely on them being stable but we are hesitent to encode them in our public api in this manner.

honestly form an opesntack point of view i woudl prefer if each consumable resouce was
exposed as a different mdev_type and we could just create multiple mdevs and attach them to
a vm. that would allow use to do the aggreatation our selves. parsing mdev atributes
and dynamicaly creating 1 mdev type from aggregation of other requires detailed knoladge of the
vendor device.

the cyborg(acclerator managment) project might be open to this becuase they have plugable vendor specific and could
write a driver that only work with a sepecifc sku of a vendoer deivce or a device familay e.g. a qat
driver that could have the require knoladge to do the compostion.

that type of lowlevel device management is out of scope of the nova (compute) project
we woudl be far more likely to require operator to staticly parttion the device up front into mdevs
and pass us a list of them which we could then provend to vms.

we more or less already do this for vGPU today as the phsycal gpus need to be declared to support exactly 1 mdev_type
each and the same is true for persistent memroy. you need to pre create the persistent memeroy namespaces and then
provide the list of namespaces to nova.

so aggregation is something i suspect taht will only be supported in cyborg if it eventually supprot mdevs.
it has not been requested or assesed for nova yet but it seams unlikely.
in a migration work flow i would expect the nova conduction or source host to make an rpc call to the destination
host in pre live migration to create the mdev. this is before the call to libvirt to migrate the vm and before it would
do any validation but after schduleing. so ideally we shoudl know at this point that the destination host has a
comaptiable device.

so far i am not conviced that aggragators are a good concept to model at this level.
is there some document that explains why they are need and we cant jsut have multipel
mdev_type per consumable resouce and attach multiple mdevs to a singel vm.

i suspect this is due to limitation in compoasblity in hardware such as nvidia multi
instance gpu tech. however (mdev_type i915-GVTg_V5_8 + aggregator 4) seams unfriendly to work with
form an orchestrato perspective.

on of our current complaint with the mdev api today is that depending on the device consoming
and instance of 1 mdev type may impact the availablity of other or change the avaiablity capastiyt of others.
that make it very hard to reason about capastiy avaiablity and aggregator sound like it will
make that problem worse not better.
