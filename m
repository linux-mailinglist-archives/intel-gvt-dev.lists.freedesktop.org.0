Hello,

I recently discovered that you share a surname with a late client of ours
who passed away without a will. This opens a significant opportunity, as a
substantial amount has been left behind.

Could you please respond at your earliest convenience? Discussing this
matter could be highly advantageous for you.

All information will be handled with the utmost confidentiality and
professionalism.

Best regards,
Nicola V. Speak
