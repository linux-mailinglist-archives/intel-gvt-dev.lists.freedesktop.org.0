orney with a reputable legal & investment =C2=A0management firm. My Fir=
m mostly represents the interests of wealthy investors.

Due to the sensitivity of the position they once held in their country =
and the unstable investment environment of their country, some of our C=
lients evacuate the majority of their funds into more stable economies =
and developed nations where they can get good yield for their money.

A Reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with a few years ago wi=
th a proposal, recently approached me. What he requests is an individua=
l such as you, who will be willing to receive money on his behalf, and =
put it to good use for a period not exceeding 6 years for a start.

The Client has offered some terms which will be discussed when you show=
 interest and if you aren't interested and you know of someone looking =
for an investor, please do give him/her my contact.

Please respond to the personal address below.

Sincerely,
David Stringham
