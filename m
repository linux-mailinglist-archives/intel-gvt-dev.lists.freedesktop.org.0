66752@hotmail.com</a><br>&nbsp;<br>My Dear Friend,<br>&nbsp;<br>Greetings t=
o you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
firstly, I got your email address from an Email Directory and decided to ma=
il you for a permission to go ahead. I am Mrs. Joan Gates from United Kingd=
om, married to Dr. James R. Gates who worked with&nbsp;Exxon Mobil&nbsp;Oil=
 Company in London, before he died in a ghastly motor accident on his way t=
o a board meeting. My Husband and I were married without any children,and I=
 decided not to re-marry and presently I am 69 Years old. When my late husb=
and was alive he deposited the sum of $16.5M=20
(Sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with China Citic Bank.=
 Presently this money is still with the Bank and the management just wrote =
me as the beneficiary to come forward to receive the money or rather Issue =
a letter of authority to somebody to receive it on my behalf. I am currentl=
y in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for Cancer of the lu=
ngs and inability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a fe=
w months to live so I think the best thing to do=20
is to&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>
At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls due to the fact that my rel=
atives (They had squandered the funds I gave them for this purpose before n=
ow and are around me I have been helping orphans and the orphanage/motherle=
ss homes. I have also donated some money for humanitarian needs in Sudan, S=
outh Africa, Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian countries. I ha=
ve been touched to the good work of humanity through you, rather than allow=
 my relatives to use my husband's hard earned=20
funds inappropriately. I know i have never met you but my mind tells me to =
do this, and I hope you act sincerely.<br>&nbsp;<br>I want you to send me t=
he following information if you are interested as an emblem that you are th=
e right beneficiary. As soon as I receive your information, I shall give yo=
u the contact details of the bank, authorization letter and my picture with=
 the doctor as an authenticity of my integrity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Your Full Name=
,<br>&nbsp;<br>Your Contact Address,<br>&nbsp;<br>
Your Phone Number,<br>&nbsp;<br>Your Age,<br>&nbsp;<br>Your Occupation and<=
br>&nbsp;<br>Any of your identifications<br>&nbsp;<br>This is to ensure tha=
t nothing jeopardizes my last wish on Earth. I await your urgent reply. Ema=
